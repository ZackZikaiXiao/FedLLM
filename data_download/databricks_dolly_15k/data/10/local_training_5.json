Depending on the target distance and speed, this training unit can be designed differently. A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.\nAnother way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.\nOverall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions.

The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed.

After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.

In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily.

(Especially in American English, the word \"stocks\" is also used to refer to shares.) A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Who won the 2022 NBA Finals MVP?", "context": "", "response": "Stephen Curry", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What\u2019s the difference between Delta Live Tables and Workflows?", "context": "", "response": "These are some of the main differences between Delta Live Tables and Workflows:\n\n- Workflows is complementary to Delta Live Tables\n- Workflows is a control flow that allows end-to-end orchestration of tasks that might include one or more DLT Pipelines.\n- A workflow consists of one or more tasks, which could be a Spark job, a DLT Pipeline, an ML job, some random python code, etc. \n- DLT Pipelines is a data flow.

Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.\n\nBioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.\n\nImage and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data.

Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias.

For example, during the 16-day festival in 2014, 7.7 million litres (2,000,000 US gal) were served,[1] making it the year where the most beer was consumed at the Oktoberfest.[2] Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.\n\nThe Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to German reunification. As a result, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October (German Unity Day). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is a hockey hat trick ?", "context": "", "response": "when a player scores three goals in a game, usually earning him a cascade of hats thrown onto the ice by fans (especially if the player is on the home team).

American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn\u2019t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field.

The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).

First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the states for funding.  If the states didn\u2019t like legislation passed, they could simply withhold funding. Fourth, amendments to the AoC required the unanimous agreement of all thirteen states.

To understand this, just think of a prism.  White light enters, and a rainbow of colors exits. Our sun is like that.

Atmospheric gases and particles scatter the incoming colors, bouncing them in all different directions.  The amount of scattering increases as the wavelength of light decreases.  Red light which has a long wavelength is scattered much less than blue light which has a short wavelength. As blue is scattered more, it fills our daytime sky.\n\nAs the sun traverses the sky and moves low on the horizon, the light that reaches our eyes must actually travel further through the atmosphere.

And forward-thinking companies recognise that with the ability to analyse information efficiently, they can optimise their efforts, use resources more efficiently, and have an advantage in their industry.\n\nThere are many advantages that a business gains when using GIS, and it is transforming industries such as utilities, infrastructure, environment management, and others:\n\nThe industries using GIS serve some of our most fundamental needs.\nEnvironmental Agencies\n\nGIS gathers and stores critical data for environmental agencies to track and monitor habitat, wetland, and coastal shoreline erosion, identify locations where threatened species live, water sources and other natural resources. It can also help to track patterns and help predict natural disasters, glacier changes and soil erosion.\n\nAll of the environmental data gathered is essential in helping with conservation, protection and restoration efforts. Other industries can also access and utilise the data collected by researchers and conservationists.\nUtility Companies\n\nOne of the most active users of GIS is the utility sector, and they use it to help with: \n\n    Managing grids and identifying patterns in customer usage, outages and supply issues\n    Tracking and monitoring pipelines\n    Locating water pipes and cables\n    Wireless networks\n    Construction planning\n    Monitor assets and field workers\n\nGIS, with its comprehensive database, helps to maintain and monitor overhead and underground utilities, improving efficiency and effectiveness and saving time and money\nInfrastructure Companies\n\nThe planning and development of our roads, electricity, water supply lines, buildings, and society\u2019s basic framework is mapped, managed, and monitored by companies that incorporate GIS in the infrastructure industry.\n\nGIS simplifies communications, improves efficiency and effectiveness for field workers, helps to monitor assets and workers, tracks and stores customer usage and issues, improves customer/client satisfaction, and much more.\nTelecommunications\n\nGIS is widely used in the telecom sector to help monitor real-time data about current use, outages, and signal strength to help them better understand customers\u2019 patterns and needs. \n\nThe telecom companies also use GIS to help optimise their resources effectively and efficiently, mitigate problems and plan for future growth.\nRetail\n\nRetail stores depend on knowing where their customer base lives or works and how far they are willing to travel to buy goods. GIS supplies essential data to help retail companies determine location, optimise inventory and sales, and plan their marketing campaigns to reach their ideal clientele.\nGovernment\n\nGeographical information is critical for the government to make decisions based on real-time data.  Government operations are spatial, whether for emergency response and management, fires, accidents, utilities, infrastructure, etc.\nAgriculture\n\nFood is a basic need for humans and animals. The agricultural industry uses GIS to help identify usable fertile land vs non-fertile land, weather hazards such as flooding or drought, and water supply.\nDevelopment and Urban Planning\n\nPlanners and developers rely on GIS to help them factor in several components when looking to build and develop an area. For example, they use GIS to find empty lots and determine resource and infrastructure availability and needs.\n\nGIS helps plan roads, housing, schools, businesses, government spaces, and hospitals. It also stores historical data, including ageing infrastructure, monuments, wetland areas, protected habitats, and species.\n\nAnother important factor is soil mapping, identifying possible hazards such as flooding, volcanic activity or other environmental issues.\nHealthcare\n\nToday, healthcare sectors use GIS to track disease patterns, whether an outbreak, an epidemic, cancer hotspots, or people in a specific location suffering from an environmentally caused illness. \n\nGIS has a disease surveillance system that can conduct a spatial analysis to locate which area is high-risk, and the GIS software is better are validating data.\nInsurance Companies\n\nMitigating and understanding risks ahead of time is essential to insurance companies, and they use GIS to ensure they are aware of possible dangers before giving you a quote.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Can a neutral wire in a home electrical circuit give me an electric shock", "context": "", "response": "Ideally the answer would be no.

Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall. Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\n\nFascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition. Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation. Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a totalitarian one-party state. Fascism's extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifests as belief in racial purity or a master race, usually blended with some variant of racism or bigotry against a demonized \"Other\" that is seen as an existential threat.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Give me a two sentence summary of the following text: \"A Venn diagram illustrates the relationships between two or more data sets.

The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Are iodized salt and kosher salt the same?", "context": "", "response": "No, they are two different types of salt.

Elden Ring was a video game released for multiple platforms in circa 2022 to critical acclaim. \n\nIf MH4U and Elden Ring were considered to be siblings nine years apart in a small family, how might the experiences of MH4U have influenced the growth and development of Elden Ring?", "context": "", "response": "Young parents face many challenges. Finances, education, and home expenses often compete with the needs of a growing family. Within the context provided, MH4U reflects the first child of a young couple who must make several investments, including clothing, baby essentials, and furniture.  This may be conveyed under the limited system resources available to MH4U under the 3DS console: 128MB of RAM. Additionally, one or both parents may work full time, leaving limited time to work with and grow the child. As the child, MH4U,  enters age 9, they should be entering 4th or 5th grade and have developed the cognitive and functional skills to support their parents. Additionally, the parents will have likely developed further in their careers and caretaking abilities that ensure the stability and growth of a small family. In this example, Elden Ring represents the second child, which arrives nine years after MH4U. In this context, as a result of the growth of experience and income of the family, and assuming the family equates to a Playstation 4, the family now enjoys 8GB of RAM.\n\nAs described in the preceding paragraph, the familial environment that Elden Ring emerges from is vastly different than that of MH4U. However, there are additional benefits beyond the system limitations provided. These benefits are conveyed through the emotional and physical support provided through familial bonds, in this case, that of an older and younger sibling. Upon the arrival of Elden Ring, MH4U is eager to help their parents with caretaking tasks which may include keeping the child company, completing small jobs and errands, and establishing familial bonds with their sibling. The parents will be able to draw upon the experience of raising MH4U and apply those lessons to their newest member of the family. It\u2019s important that the parents continue to create small jobs for MH4U that help to convey positive responses to younger family members: caretaking, guidance, and companionship. \n\nAs MH4U graduates from their teens and enters early adulthood, it\u2019s critical that they stay actively involved in the life of their sibling. By age 18, MH4U will now be nine years older than Elden Ring, which as it happens, is the same age when MH4U became an older sibling. Under this lens, MH4U carries greater social responsibility than they did when they were the same age as Elden Ring. MH4U may also begin to contemplate leaving the family for continuing education. While it\u2019s common for individuals to depart the family for secondary education after age 18, it\u2019s critically important that MH4U continue to maintain constant contact with its younger sibling to provide guidance and advice and convey lessons learned from its formative experiences.  \n\nIn this way, Elden Ring has a fast track to develop. MH4U is able to provide guidance equatable to best practices, experiences, and trial and error. Additionally, MH4U development during constrained resources encourages Elden Ring to do \u201cmore with less\u201d and ensures a fastidious approach towards the allocation of resources. By the time Elden Ring approaches age 18, they enjoy the combined experiences of their parents and their older sibling which helps to increase their likelihood of success and families are stronger when they provide guidance and stability to their children.\n\nIn summary, the success of Elden Ring was no accident. The investments of the parents into the older sibling, MH4U, however lacking, provided a baseline level by which MH4U could invest in its younger sibling Elden Ring. Through this chain of investments, the family finds a greater chance of success. Under the lens of the original context, there would not be a critically reception to Elden Ring had not the parents made baseline investment and support to MH4U during the formative years of the family.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Q: Am I eligible for a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and if so, which one?", "context": "", "response": "A:  Individuals may receive a single booster dose of one of the authorized bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, when eligible, as follows:\n\nChildren who are 6 months through 5 years of age who received primary vaccination with Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may receive a single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent at least two months after completion of primary vaccination.\n\nChildren who are 6 months through 4 years of age who received primary vaccination with three doses of the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  may receive a single booster dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent at least 2 months after completion of primary vaccination.\n\nChildren who are 5 years of age who received primary vaccination with Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may receive either the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, Bivalent as a single booster dose at least two months after completion of primary vaccination.\n\nChildren who are 5 years of age who received primary vaccination doses with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, including children whose third dose was with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, may receive only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent as a single booster dose at least two months after completion of primary vaccination.\n\nIndividuals who are 6 years of age and older may receive a single booster dose with either the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, Bivalent at least 2 months after either:\n\nCompletion of a primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.\nor\n\nThe most recent booster dose with any FDA-authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What should I do if I'm feeling depressed?", "context": "", "response": "It's completely normal to feel depressed from time to time.

The first was legalism, which used the courts to attack discriminatory laws or practices.  The limits of legalism are the cost, slow change, burden on the individual and it was elite driven.  The second was nonviolent direct action (NVDA).  NVDA identifies an unjust law which is then broken by individuals trying to promote change.  Individuals must then accept the consequences of breaking the law, but if enough do so, it puts pressure on local governments.  The third strategy was political action, which used voting on proactive agendas to force change.  Finally, the fourth strategy was the black power movement.  This strategy promoted disengagement from white-society and setting up a separate black power structure.  It provided services to the black community and promoted positive black images, but had weak leadership and was prone to violence and paranoia.\nIf I was advising a civil rights group today, I would advise them to use the first three strategies.  Legalism, NVDA and political action are positive and effective ways to enable change.  They usually encourage sympathetic news coverage and get the message of the group out to the broader public.  A strategy like the black power movement would not be effective.  If you want to change society, you can\u2019t separate from it or try to change it from the outside.

The primary mistake people make when cold calling is in defining what success looks like.  For most sales roles, the goal of a cold call is to establish rapport, not to book an order.  Think about it - when was the last time you purchased something by phone the first time you were contacted?  Odds are that several follow ups were required before you were ready to buy, no matter how qualified a buyer you appeared to be.  \n\nEstablishing rapport means getting your prospect to open up, because he/she has determined that you are worth the time to do so.  So the keys to establishing rapport are simple:  be courteous and respectful, provide appropriate context, and be OPEN.   Let's consider each of these individually.  First, courtesy and respect- after briefly introducing yourself, ask the prospect if now is a good time to talk for a few minutes?  We've all experienced the annoyance of a caller who dives right into the conversation immediately after hearing a \"hello\".  Be respectful of your prospect's schedule and give him/her an \"out.\"  If it's not a good time, you're not going to have a successful call no matter what you try.  \n\nNext, provide appropriate context.  Don't assume he/she knows nothing about what you are trying to sell. If that were the case, this prospect wouldn't be a very good target for you! Prepare a short introductory statement that can be delivered in a genuine way with a friendly tone.  For example, \"I'm with ACME Mobile Window Repair and wanted to share some spring promotions with you - have you seen our trucks around your neighborhood?\"  Setting context will help build rapport by providing a clear understanding of why you are calling, and what you hope to get out of the conversation.  Successful sales people are very comfortable with the fact that they are trying to sell something.  Own it, but do so in a low key and friendly way, and this will help lower the defenses of your prospect if he/she sounds guarded\n\nLastly, be open.  This means open to going off script, open to hearing about competition or open to negative impressions of what you're selling.  An open dialogue allows room for questions, both from you and from your prospect.     Think about an enjoyable conversation you've had lately.  Was it a natural back and forth, with questions posed and answers provided?  Did the questions take the conversation into a deeper dialogue?  A successful cold call is one that feels like a natural conversation about a topic of shared interest. If your prospect goes off on a tangent, don't redirect too soon, or better yet - ask a question - \"I'm curious - What made you think of carpets when I mentioned windows?\"  If he/she goes negative about your offering, ask another question  - \"What in your experience has caused you to feel this way?\"  \n\nCold calling is a skill that can improve with practice.  The more comfortable you are being courteous, setting context, and remaining open, the better your sales outcomes will be.

Many Louisiana natives and surrounding southern states eat these crustaceans.  To eat crawfish, sometimes called crawdads or mudbugs, you first need to purchase them.  Crawfish are usually sold by the sack with typical weights around 30-40 pounds.  You must then clean the crawfish as their natural habitats are within mud, swamps, and muck.   Rinsing them thoroughly in water is required.  Many will do this a sack at a time and continue to rinse until the water is crystal clear noting that they're clean.  Others go a step further through a process of purging.  This is using salt to have the crawfish clean out its insides.  Many think purging is a myth and simply skip this step.  Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.

It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why is Kanye sometimes regarded the GOAT (Greatest of All Time)?", "context": "", "response": "Kanye Omari West (\"Ye\") is debated as being the GOAT by many in the hip hop scene due to his prolific and arguably genius utilization of samples in his production.

But assuming one has found the right person, there are comparative advantages and disadvantages to marrying at a young age or an older age. Men have the advantage of not needing to worry about the 'biological clock' - unlike women, their reproductive age can extend into quite a late age, whereas women typically lose the ability to reproduce once they hit around the age of 40. An advantage of having children when one is young is that a man will have more energy and physical dexterity to be able to engage in physical activities with his children, like camping, biking, hiking, sports, skiing, etc. Bending over to change diapers will not be as painful on the back and knees. As a younger man, travel with children may be less discomforting. As an older man, one might have more time or flexibility of time to spend with one's children. An older man may also have greater financial resources to help make child raising easier. For example, an older man might have a larger house, or a greater ability to afford in-house child care. On the other hand, there are studies that show having an older father may increase the odds of a child having autism or attention deficit disorder. Anecdotally, it seems people who marry at a young age are more likely to divorce. But perhaps having two marriages, one when one is young and another when one is older, is not a bad thing. Men have the advantage of being able to sire two sets of children at different times in their lives, making this possible.

When the highest point in the long-period wave reaches a shoreline the area experiences high tide. When the lowest point of the wave, the trough, reaches shore the area experiences low tide. The earth is mostly water and the water \"points\" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The \"pointing\" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.\n\nThe bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs. As the Earth spins, different areas of the planet face the moon, and this rotation causes the tides to cycle around the planet.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How is life like living on the pacific north west?", "context": "", "response": "Living on the west coast has many benefits.

Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile\u2019s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds \u201caccurate\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.\n \nThe Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears. By many, it is thought to be one of the best In-Ear Monitors ever made. At a retail price of over $4,000, it is also generally considered to be quite expensive. Widely regarded to perform extremely well, the Erlkonig has 13 balance armature drivers, 4 user-selectable sound settings, and shells made out of silver. While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig\u2019s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM\u2019s sound.

Once the brisket is properly seasoned, place the brisket on your pellet grill.  It is common in Texas to place the brisket fat side up.  In other areas of the country, it is more common to place the brisket fat side down.  Allow your brisket to smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees.

Why is this so?", "context": "", "response": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How can I tell my sourdough starter is ready to use?", "context": "", "response": "You can look for a few signs to see if your sourdough starter is ready to use.

Each team takes turns trying to hit a ball pitched to them by the opposing teams pitcher. If you hit the ball you run in order from first base to second to third and then home. Once the ball is hit the other team can tag you out with the ball that you hit. Each base is a safe spot to stand so you can stop at any base and let the next person on your team try to hit the ball and advance you to the next base. If you are tagged out then your team has an out. You get three outs in an inning. Once there are three outs you switch from hitting to pitching with the other team. When you are batting you get three strikes and four balls. If the pitcher throws four balls then you can walk to first base. This is called a walk. If you swing and miss the ball, that is called a strike. You can also strike out by not swinging at a pitch that is in an imaginary strike zone. This zone is there to give the pitcher something to aim and the hitter a reasonable area to hit a ball. There are 8 innings in a game. After 8 turns being up to bat the team with more runs wins.

One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age. The key is to focus on compound exercises, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, and make sure you're getting enough protein. So, what are you waiting for?

Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed , which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart.

Second, be sure to review your newly acquired houseplant for any pests before introducing them into your home. You\u2019ll want to check the leaves for mealy bugs, spider mites, etc. and the soil for pests such as fungus gnats. If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth).

We are thinking of buying a pet. What are some good pet options for our family of four? Please include some advantages and disadvantages for each option.", "context": "", "response": "Congratulations on your growing family! Pets are often treated like another member of the family and while they can require a lot of work, they can also bring a lot of joy and laughter into your life.\n\nHere are a few options for pets and some advantages and disadvantages for each:\n\n1. Dogs - Dogs can be amazing pets. They are typically very loyal, friendly, and beloved by families all over the world. Dogs can be taught to do tricks like sit, stay, and fetch. There are also over 300 different breeds of dog and they come in all kinds of sizes, ranging from a few lbs (1-2 kg) to over 150 lbs (70 kg). Dogs require quite a bit of work to train and can be very expensive to own due to high veterinary bills. Some dogs can be aggressive, and this is an important factor to consider given that you have two young children. Dogs also typically require access to a yard or regular walking to ensure that they are not going to the bathroom inside. Also, many people are allergic to dogs due to the fact that most dogs shed. If your family members are prone to allergies and are still looking to add a dog to the family, perhaps you should consider a hypoallergenic breed like a Yorkshire Terrier, poodle, or a poodle mix like a Golden Doodle. Dogs typically live between 7-15 years, depending on the breed. \n\n2. Cats - Cats are another very popular pet option for families. Like dogs, they come in many different breed options but there are far fewer breed options for cats than dogs. Most cats grow to be about 10 lbs (4 kg), but they can range in size from around 5 lbs (2 kg) to 25 lbs (11 kg). Indoor cats typically live between 12-18 years. Cats typically require far less work and are generally more independent than dogs. While most cats can't be trained to do tricks, cats are often lower maintenance than dogs. Cats can often be left alone at the house for a long time. Most cats use a litter box to relieve themselves so they typically don't need regular walks or access to a yard. Like dogs, most cats shed, so allergies and cleaning pet dander can be a nuisance. Cats typically eat less than dogs and often are less expensive to own.\n\n3. Fish - Fish are a popular pet option for families that are looking for a very low maintenance pet that only requires feeding a couple of times per day. Fish typically require water, a clean fish tank and fish food, and that's about it. Some pet fish, like goldfish, can be bought for as little as $10, while exotic fish can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Most pet fish will live up to 2 years if properly cared for, but certain species can live up to 30 years. \n\n4. Reptiles - Reptiles like snakes, lizards, or iguanas can also be pets. They typically require low maintenance and can live for up to 20-30 years. They require a cage, regular feeding, and are generally easy to take care of. For medical emergencies, they may require specialized veterinarians or doctor's, which can be hard to find.\n\n5. Rodents - rodents like gerbils, hamsters and even mice can be pets as well. They require regular feeding and a small cage, and are typically very easy to take care of. People often include a running wheel in the cage for these small animals so that they can exercise. However, they don't live very long; most rodents only live for a couple of years at most. \n\nIn addition to the list above, there are many other options for pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, pigs and even exotic options like monkeys. Depending on where you live, there may be certain restrictions on the types of pets that you can own. Please be sure to check with these restrictions before buying your family pet.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is a bank run?", "context": "", "response": "To understand a bank run you have to first understand how a bank works.

So if a customer suddenly asks for their deposits back, the bank can\u2019t immediately sell its investments to give it to them.

Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions.

There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "I am looking into buying a new monitor, how do I know which one I should buy?", "context": "", "response": "It depends a lot on the use case and how much money you want to spend.

Consumers can use an offset to track read messages.\n- Brokers: A Kafka cluster is composed of one or more brokers that manage the storage of messages in topics and serve as intermediaries between producers and consumers.\n- Producers: Applications that produce data and publish it to one or more topics in a Kafka cluster. They control how events are assigned to partitions within a topic.\n- Consumers: Applications that subscribe to one or more topics and consume published messages. The only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in a topic. This offset is controlled by the consumer.\n- Partitions: Kafka uses partitions to split a topic's messages across multiple brokers for scalability and performance. Events with the same event key, such as the same customer identifier or vehicle ID, are written to the same partition, and Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic partition will always read that partition\u2019s events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n- Replication: Multiple brokers always have a copy of the data to guarantee high availability and fault tolerance.

By combining these materials into a device called a transistor we are able to create an electronic component that will only conduct electricity when a small electric current is applied to the so-called Base pin of the transistor.\n\nOne obvious use of such behavior is to use the transistor as a switch--by applying or removing current to the base pin we are able to control whether the transistor conducts electricity via its collector and emitter pins. When no current is present at the Base pin the transistor will block electrical transmission through its emitter and collector pins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the electrical current required to control the transistor at the base pin is very small. Much larger currents can be transferred through the device through the collector and emitter pins. Thus, in effect, a transistor uses a very small input current to control the flow of a much larger current.\n\nAn audio signal, for example, is transmitted as a very low power electrical current--in it's original form it is too small to be able to drive a loudspeaker to make sounds that are audible to the human ear. To amplify this signal so that is usable for audio playback we can apply the audio signal to a transistor's base pin--this will allow a much larger current to flow between the emitter and collector pins and through the transistor. Since the flow of this large current will mirror the much smaller current of the audio signal we will have effectively created a much stronger version of the original input signal.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Should I buy a Shinkansen Rail Pass if I visit Japan?", "context": "", "response": "Shinkansen Rail Pass is quite expensive.

It's hilarious to see deities of old living mundane lives, frankly quite charming. Our characters navigate through a spooky setting, but it's never overbearing nor depressing.\n\nBut what really makes this book special are the characters and dialogue. Shadow and Wednesday are an amazing duo; between Shadows quiet reflections and Wednesday's blunt terrorizing, the pair travel across rural America, running through a plethora of interesting icons and people.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How to introduce a new cat to the household if you already have cats?", "context": "", "response": "Confine the new cat to a single room.

Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches.

The malting process renders the grain usable to the brewer. It's basically taking a live seed, steeping it in water and tricking it into thinking it's time to grow.\" The grain starts to ready itself to grow into a plant but the germination is then stopped by drying the barley. Malting helps to create the enzymes necessary to convert the starches present in the seeds into sugars. Without malting, the beer would not have enough sugar content to properly ferment.\n\nThe malted barley is crushed or milled and then soaked in warm water in order to create a sugar solution known as wort. Any other grains used in the brewing process are also added at this point. Soaking the grains in warm water helps to further convert the starches into the sugars necessary for fermentation.\n\nThe wort is then moved to a copper pot and boiled. During boiling, some of the water in the wort evaporates, leaving behind a higher concentration of sugars. Boiling also helps to sterilize the mixture in preparation for fermentation. \n\nAfter boiling, the solid hops and grain are removed, and the mixture is cooled. The brewers then add yeast to this mixture. Fermenting with yeast is what makes beer alcoholic. The time it takes to ferment a beer varies based on type of yeast and style of fermentation, but most beers take about a week to ferment.\n\nDifferent strains of yeast and different fermentation techniques determine what kind of beer is being made and how it will taste. For example, when making a lager, the yeast ferments at the bottom of the wort at a cooler temperature. Ales are made with a different strain of yeast, and top fermented at warmer temperatures. After fermentation, the beer is then cooled again before bottling or canning.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Should I use a dynamic microphone or a condenser microphone for recording a podcast?

There is no universal answer or age that a child is ready to be potty trained.

Another factor is when the care taker has the time to dedicate to consistent practice of eliminating in a toilet instead of a diaper. Infant potty training also known as elimination communication is the practice of skipping the reliance of the usage of diapers.  In this practice, the caretaker will teach signs to the baby every time the baby eliminates in the toilet (not in a diaper) - the baby will eventually pick up these signs and give cues when they need to go.  Those that subscribe to infant potty training believe that conventional diapers train babies to ignore their natural instincts by removing the discomfort one would normally sense from having wet skin (achieved by chemicals that absorb liquid and wick moisture away from the skin found in many disposable diapers).

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the \"modern NBA\", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the \"strictly dominate\" strategy as this allows the \"modern\" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy.

The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table.

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation.

The statue had an inscription identifying it as an image of Helios, the god of the sun and local deity to Rhodes. In the wider Ancient Greek world Helios would likely be identified more readily as Apollo. The statue may have been made in the likeness of Alexander the Great's official image. This would have served to represent a bond between Rhodes and Alexandria with Alexander's image serving as the founder of the Egyptian city. Support for this idea comes from the fact that the Colossus was made to celebrate Rhodes' victory over a siege. This victory was largely facilitated by Ptolemy from Alexandria, and Alexandria is also a likely source for the funds of the ambitious project. The artist Chares of Lindos would also have been well selected to achieve this double representation. He was local to the island of Rhodes (Lindos is another city on the same island) and would have been familiar with images of Helios. He was also the student of Lysippos who was the exclusive personal sculptor to Alexander the Great during his lifetime, and so Chares would have also been uniquely knowledgeable about the image of Alexander. Some but not all scholars argue for the Colossus to be understood as an image of Alexander posing as Helios that would be seen by the people of Rhodes as their local deity but seen by the people of Alexandria as their founder. The Statue of Liberty built by France and gifted to the USA was partially modeled after the Colossus and is similarly possible to read as a celebration of American independence and also a reference to one the three values Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9 central to French identity.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why do so many people say it is special to be a grandparent?", "context": "", "response": "Many people say that being a grandparent is special.

Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.  Higher swingweight will also provide more stability in the racquet but will sacrifice maneuverability.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Which technology is best to learn for 2023 and the future?", "context": "", "response": "Artificial Intelligence, which is also popularly known as (AI), hits the top of the list of technologies 2023 to learn.

He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.\n\nFord was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township to a Belgian family, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.\n\nFord's 1908 introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford was also among the pioneers of the five-day work week. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.\n\nFord was widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I. In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitic content through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book, The International Jew. After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates. He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. He died in 1947 after leaving most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his family.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "My heating bill is too high.

Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  \n\nAll great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.\n\nWith their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.

Press down the clutch pedal with one foot, and the brake with your other foot first and then turn on the engine of the car. It is recommended to shift to neutral immediately after turning on your car and prior to departing. To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the \"1\" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear. You can track this limit through the RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge on the dashboard of your car. Typically you want to keep the RPMs between 1500-4000. If the RPMs start to decrease to 1500-2000 that is a sign you want to shift from a higher gear to a lower gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 1st gear), and as the RPMs increase to 4000, that is an indication you want to shift to a higher gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 3rd gear).", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why do people like plants?", "context": "", "response": "Plants build relaxing environment and decorate you room.
