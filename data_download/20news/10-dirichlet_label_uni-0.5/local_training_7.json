First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).

But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\n    nationwide.\n\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\n    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\n    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\n    Johnston says.\n\n   ",

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement.

I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a\npassion for serving Christ.\n\nOn one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural\ninterference'' in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations\ndirected at Wycliffe.
