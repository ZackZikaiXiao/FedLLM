There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n     ",

I keep \ngetting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the \nprogram. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so \nI can't seem to explain why it crashes.\n\nAll it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and\nafter a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads\nme to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  \n\nDoes the program take memory up when it is calling void functions\nthat do not return anything??\n\n\tI have been working on this problem for days and I would really\nappreciate any responce.

I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI d",
