Questions to Israelis\n\n\nDear Josh\n\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\n\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\n\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\n\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\nYou did not respond to my question.\n\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\n\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\nMa'ariv article ",

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give \nyour question a shot. \n\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\n\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \n\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or \nHP wouldn't sell many......\n\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \nlike a tank.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way y",

People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.

In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.

Actions\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\n\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\n\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\n\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\nperforming works.\n\n``Not by ",
