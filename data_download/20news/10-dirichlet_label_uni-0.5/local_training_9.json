Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Def",

I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).

A TTL gate has the basic structure\nof AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just\nexactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products\nis that this matches a hardware optimization.\n\n\tA positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has\nTWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)\nso that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can \nbe expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.\nECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND\ngate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and\ninverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).\n\n\tPALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT\ngates (with your choice of internal connections between the\nvarious sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum\nof products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into \na few PALs.

Otherwise, the key \nmanagement problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system \nunworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place\nat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in \ntheir data base?\n\nThis means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key \nalgorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is \nrather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making\nchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds\nare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that \ncould break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   \n\nAs for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to\nban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it.
