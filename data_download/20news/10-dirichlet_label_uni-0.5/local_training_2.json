The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Mago",

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.

If I wanted to  \nrebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  \nhave cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.\n\nThe Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  \nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.

If the (naive)\nmarket is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong \nencryption will be unable to compete.

They are largely out of order.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 11, 1992\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\n\n\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\n\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in\nJune.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\n\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\n-------------------------------------------------------------",

But apart from that little \nconundrum...\n\nIt would seem that a society with a \"failed\" government would be an ideal\nsetting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose\nthat never seems to occur?...\n\nI wouldn't call it \"vague.\"  I'd call it elastic.  All \"regulation\" is \nnot necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some \nlibertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that\nregulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason\nmany of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. \n\njsh",
