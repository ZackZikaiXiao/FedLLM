Well, who cares.\n\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\n\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\nwhich is now ready to work.\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\nwith 160 seed-bits.
