Displaying all 256 levels\nsynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After\nexperimenting with different aperture settings and screen\nbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable\ncontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no\nvisible contrast bands.\n\nTo minimize the exposure time the display program built 255\ndifferent 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels\nthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,\netc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was\nvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these\nframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera\nshutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote\ndirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.\n\nOur biggest problem was that small images were displ",

Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...
