Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time?

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, ou",
