This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.

You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try t",

Investigation showed that some X\nservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while\nothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing\nto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -\na Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a\nSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on\nNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. \nActually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root\nwinodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this\nbehavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!\n",
