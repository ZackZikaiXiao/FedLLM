The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy",

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was t",
