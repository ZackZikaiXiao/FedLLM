    "context": "\n\n\n\nJohn,\nThe problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without\nbothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that\none needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the\nwork of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time\nto examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will \ngrasp more clearly what I am saying.\n\n\n\n\nCertainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most \nclearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a\nbelief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No,\nthe spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be\nwilling to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so \nmonologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't\nseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)\nthere are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been\ndoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that\neven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national\nboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be\nwilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\ncannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection\njust cannot stand up to critical examination.",

    "context": "We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.\nThe toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n\nfacility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's \nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\nuses Xsi.\n\nOur toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.\nIn order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\nand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\n\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\n\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\nXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\nsource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.\n\n\n//I18N.h\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\n\n#ifndef _I18N_H\n#define _I18N_H\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *buflen,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t char **charset);\t/* OUT */\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\n\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\n\n//I18N.cc\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include \"I18N.h\"\n\nextern \"C\" {\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#undef _Xmbfscs\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\n\t\t\t\t\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\n};\n\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\n\t\t\t  int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t  char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *buf_len,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  char **charset)\t/* OUT */\n{\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\n    int ctid;\n    int status;\n    Charset *xcharset;\n    \n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\n\t\t\t\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\n    if (status == Success) {\n\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\n\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\n    }\n    else\n\t*charset = NULL;\n    return status;\n}\n----------------\n\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\n\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\n\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\n\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\nbecause HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \nknow how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used \nits internal functions. \n\nThe HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\nWe observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\nnot sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not\nseem to lead us a solution.\n\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\n'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\nwant to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.\n\nIn order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source \nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\n\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\neven if it is not HP's implementation.\n\nThank you.\n",

Prince has never hit well in\nthe minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter\nin the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have\nanother brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville \nbefore coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up\nin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the \nmajors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he \nbecame Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation \nas an outstanding defensive catcher.

    "context": "Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     \"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\" announced\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5",

But I ask, what holds  \nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \nfaith?\n\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \"Why does the\nuniverse exist\" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\nit can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\nquestion invalid?\n= : I don't believe *any*\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n= \n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten\nbeyond the \"shooting the messenger\" stage).\n\nM. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \"What do I \nas an individual Christian base my faith on?\"  Will it be shaken by the\nproduction of evidence that shatters our \"sacred cows\" or will we seek to\nunderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and\ncontinues to say) in his Word?\n\n\"Why do I ask why?\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).\n\nJason.\n\n\n",

As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n\t\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460.",

They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.",

    "context": "04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir\n\nBy NEJLA SAMMAKIA\n Associated Press Writer\n   \nGUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have\nbegun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner \nof the Caucasus.\n\nThe region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,\nAbkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former\nSoviet Union to fight for independence.\n\nLezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the\nconscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared\nwar with Armenia.\n\nThey also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which\nwere effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national\nborders that had been only lines on a map.\n\nA rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and\ndemand a separate \"Lezghistan\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.\n\nOfficials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six\ndemonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\n\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\n\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\nwar they say is not theirs.\n\n\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\n\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\n\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\n\n\"The police don't force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\n\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\n\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\n\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\n\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\n\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \nthe Russians.\"\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\n\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\n\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\n\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\n\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\nBut Baku won't listen to us.\"\n\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\n\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\n\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \nschool classes in their language.\n\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\nAzerbaijan.\n\n\n\n",

And how do you know that\nthe version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same\nas the one that will be really used?\n\nRegarding the mistake - even the few information \"they\" have let out\nhas revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key\nis split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily\nbreakable, if you have only one of the keys.\n\n\nThe Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed; NSA is\nmotivated by their wish to control the people. That's why the drug\ndealers have their accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American\nones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess\nthey'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming\nsuddenly popular... :-)\n\n\nIt's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give.\nIt's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of\nmoney behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most\ncorporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it\ntoo. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely\navailable now not because of some plot, but because the companies\ndon't see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the\ncompanies can see any penalties associated with it...\n\n\nYeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new\nsystem.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin",

The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()\nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the\nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same\nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be\nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above\nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless\nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They\nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple\nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\t\t      |\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t      |\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners\nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\t      |\nX    year.

But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few\nrigged \"quotations\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir\nYassin \"massacre.\"\n\nYou have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.\nAt the most basic level, you should know that there is a big\ndifference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding\n\"quotations\" that support your preset opinions.\n\nIf you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that\nmany of the sources of your \"quotations\" have an axe to grind, and\ntherefore you must be very careful about whom you \"quote.\"  For\nexample, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,\nand a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\nshows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\ncourse you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\n\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.\nIt's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\n\"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\n\nThe Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if\nthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\n\nPlease, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff\nwith facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version\nunless you find something serious to contradict it.",

Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.",

PC World,\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your\nlibrary.\n\nI've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\nfinances.\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\n\n\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\n\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\n\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\n\n\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\n\tbudget.\n\n\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\n\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\n\t\n\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\n\n\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\n\n\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\n\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\n\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.\n\n\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\n\tprograms.\n\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\nQuicken does not:\n\n\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\n\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine\n\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.\n\n\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\n\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\n\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\n\n\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \n\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\n\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\n\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \n\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\n\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\n\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\n\ta particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.\n\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\n\tyour kids with their tuition.  \n\n\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\n\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \n\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\n\tare automatically included here.\n\n\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\n\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\n\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\n\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\n\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\n\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\n\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\n\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost\nsure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\n\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \nWindows version.

    "context": "\nOK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.

For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much\nconfusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been\nto their benefit and comfort.\"\n\nBradford did not blame this failure on the \"strangers\", but on the basic\nselfishness in all men.  He wrote \"seeing all men have this corruption in\nthem, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\"  In other\nwords, according to Westbrook, \"Bradford found private enterprise to be\nthe most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\"\n\nLet's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\n\n\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\n\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\n\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\n\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\n\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\n\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\n\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\n\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\noccupying forces.\n\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \nbackbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\n\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\n\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\nwithin the following principles:\n\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \n  law;\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\n  Turkish nation;\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\n  sex, or political beliefs;\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\n\n\"Structure of the State\"\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\nother (self-control).\n\n A. Legislative Power:\n\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\n\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\n - to ratify international agreements;\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\n\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\n of twenty-one can vote.\n\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \n independent judges.\n\n B. Executive Power:\n\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\n\n - to represent the State and the Country;\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\n \n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \n call for a referendum.\n\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\n Ministers in the Council.\n\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\n functions against any law.\n\n C. Judicial Power:\n\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\n\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\n   high administrative court.\n\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\n\n\nSerdar Argic",

    "context": "KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)\nKS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nKS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nKS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information\n\nI'm not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\n\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\n\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\n\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\nyears.\n\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\nneuropsychologic tests.\n\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\nwithout PPS complaints).",

Even if the 'menu' system\n'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero\nvalue in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS\nabout it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use\nDOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do\nthe BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed\nproperly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS\ncalls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time\nincrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some\nother DOS call.",

However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows\nprogramming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with\nthe native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the\nsake of changing the API, are valuable.\n\n  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the\nmemory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less\nimportant. \n\n  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch\ncomponents from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff\n (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.\n\nThe two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two\ntoolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if\nanyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).\n\nA couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:\n\nZApp\n----\n  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and\n    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.\n  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)\n  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.\n  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.\n \nZinc\n----\n  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)\n  Comes with a interface builder tool\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  \n  Had a better demo :-)\n\nBoth have source code availability options\nBoth are lacking OLE support\nNeither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff\n\n\nAny thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n  Brett Harper\n",

The purpose of the conference was to\npublish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed\nto prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it\nbacked away from the \"Family Values\" positons of the '92 convention.\n\nConservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization\nwith political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications\nsupport.\n\nThe Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version\nof the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.\nMs. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom\nCouncil in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.\n\nMs. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989\nto manage Legatus, a \"nonpolitical\", Catholic businessmen's group.\nMembership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4\nmillion in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts\nat Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the\nCatholic Campaign.\n\nThe Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.\nRobert K.

Also on the national\ncommittee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice.

All humanitarian, constitutional human rights\nguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,\ndocuments signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.\n\nThe USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan\nthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures to\nguarantee life and peace.\n\nThe 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's\ntacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against\nAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n\t\tTHE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n\nBut perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus\nin the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the\nAzerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved\nby the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict\nlie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which\nwere the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of\nthousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. \n\nRecently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred\nthousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and\nHuman Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims\nat 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole\nthing has now gone entirely too far.\n\n\nThey already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians \n78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this \ntime in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the \nplots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. \n\nReport taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992\n\n                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED\n\n     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today \nof a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, \na predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.\n     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed\n1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and \nmassacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered\nmountain passes.\n     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani\nreports of a massacre.\n\n                         Scalping Reported\n     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region\nby helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their\nheads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them \nfrom retrieving more bodies.\n     \"Women and children have been scalped,\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide\nto Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \"When we began to pick up bodies,\nthey began firing at us.\"\nare lying there like flocks of sheep.

Second, that scientists\n(for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity. \nScientists are empircists, not theologians.\n\n\nSo do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and \nfundamental misunderstanding of science.\n\n\nAbsolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs).

Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider\neach time you think you do.\n\n\nThat was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power ....\nScientists generally agree with that.  That's a far cry from saying God did.\nPlease attempt to understand your own posts.\n \n\nI have your info, and I have replied - several days ago.  Hope you have it.  \nSomehow your post above appeared at my server only today.\n",

    "context": "\n \n\nGood point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,\nRuth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote\nfrom the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not\ndisqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the\nWisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially\nin the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom\n13-14).\n\n[stuff deleted]\n\n \nTrue.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the\nbooks of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole\nargument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not\nuniversally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and\nothers were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for\nthe Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the\nDeuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I\nthink) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of\nBaranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament\nonly, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.\n\n\n\n\tYou're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn.\"\n\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\n\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\nMaccabees.\"\n\t-Origen, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" Psalm 1 (245 AD)\n\n\"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].\"\n\t-St. Clement of Alexandria, \"The Instuctor of Children,\" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\n\n\"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of\nSolomon, and also Wisdom ...\"\n\t-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' \"History of the\nChurch,\" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14\n\n\"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine\nScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must\nshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of\nMaccabees, two books.\"\n\t-St. Damasus I, Pope, \"The Decree of Damsus,\" section 2 (382 AD)",

Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\nof Judaism\".\n\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\noutside Israel \"who were using other people's countries like\nhotels\".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\ncharacter\".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.\n",

    "context": "\n\nSorry, you're right.  I did not clearly state it.\n\n\n\nThe most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational\nattitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),\nand then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their\nassumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a\nlack of consistency here.\n\nNow I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God\ndoes not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational\npeople have problems with that \"logic\"?\n\nBut you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.\n\n\n;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?\n\n\n\nIt might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was\nthat mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who\nthey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or\nhammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's\nstill a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also\nbecause people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he\nhad wrought.\n\n\nFirst, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not\nsway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?\n\nOne of the big reasons is that many, many people want something\nbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for\none can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.\n\nAnd there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.\nCan love as a truth be proven, logically?\n\n\n\nJohn the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see\nhow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast\nin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,\nI do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,\nyou might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,\nJesus, for instance.\n\n\nI speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence\nsupporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting\nlove as truth is subjective.\n\n\nNo apology necessary.  :)\n--\nBake Timmons, III",

Notes\n========\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\n\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying \"I can't FTP, could\nsomeone mail this to me?\"  There are a number of automated mail servers\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n3.

Very simple, there are some\n  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects\n  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in\n  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can\n  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.\n  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)\n\nOFF\n---\n  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).\n[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,\n I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]\n\n  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this\n  service, send a message with a \"Subject:\" line containing only the word\n  \"help\" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.\n  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF\n  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in\n  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,\n  also on gondwana.\n\nTDDD\n----\nIt's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,\nRayshade, Imagine or vort objects.\nEdited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):\n\n  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley\n  (worley@cup.portal.com)\n\n  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format\n  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\n\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

The P3D uses lisp with slight\n  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp\n  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to\n  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.\n\n  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon\n  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D\n  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.\n\n  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:\n  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,\n  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from\n  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.\n\n  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines\n  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory\n  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.\n\nRenderMan\n---------\n  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n8. Solids description formats\n=============================\n\na.

IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid\n  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987\n  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at\n  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325\n  and the cost is $100.\n  This standard is not available in electronic format.\n\nc. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only\n  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.\n  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get\n  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov\n  and putting the line\n\tsend index\n  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.\n\n  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working\n  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,\n  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.\n  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.\n\n  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),\n  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or\n          mm%inf.rl.ac.uk@NSFnet-relay.ac.uk\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Part 1 of the Resource Listing",

The Israeli  secret service,\n       Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant\n       information in connection  with the camps set  up in the\n       Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of\n       militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for\n       the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close\n       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian\n       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos\n       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated\n       that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military\n       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.\n       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for\n       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing\n       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the\n       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist\n       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations\n       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they\n       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a\n       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos\n       mountains.\n\n       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,\n       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in\n       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs\n       of the  camps.

They  added  that  he\n       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the\n       PKK  and avoid clashing with it.

    "context": ": I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for \n: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\n: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\n: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\n: obsolete by Jesus.\n\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\n: punishable.\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\n: and Gentile alike.\n\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\nchange that?\n\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\n\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\n\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\nmade the means look frightening.\n\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\nto debate with these people.\n\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\n\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\nthe will of God.\n\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\n\n: God be with you,\n\nNot yours, thanks ;)\n\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\n\nRob Lanphier\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\n\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:",

[1]\n\nBorn 1964\nSecretary-Typist\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\n\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\nMicrodistrict No. 3\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\n\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation \nwhatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There \nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \nto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we've \nscared them enough, let's leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \nand it was dark . . .\n\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \nwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \nlive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \ndriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \nhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \nOK . . .\n\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \nnothing had happened.\n\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \ndidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\nguess.\n\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\nhome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \nZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\nour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \nare they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \nthat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \ncabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\non in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \nWe cleared the table.\n\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \nsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\nsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \nan Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\nthat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \nfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\ngot up and left or not.\n\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \nkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \nthem.\n\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \nand it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \ndin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \nshouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\nsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \nthey'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \nthat we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \nthat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \nher anything or not.\n\nThen . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \ncommanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \nin front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \nthemselves who would go first.\n\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \nHe looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \nwindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\nI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \ndon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\nelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n \nI come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \nclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \nhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\nthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \nbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \nand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \nto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \nthere. So they survived.\n\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \nin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \nand we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\nwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n\nI came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \ncame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \nsimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \nit was hard to breathe . . .\n\nMy supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \nwithout stopping. After us.\n\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\nfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\nquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \nhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \nthe soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \nDaghestan police were there.\n\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \nknow what to do with the rest.\"\n\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \nboss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \nambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \nthink of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \nthem.\n\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \nyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\nward.\n\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \ncouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\nthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \nArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\nthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \nand off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \nafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \nI didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \ncould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \nwho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\nmyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \nfrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \nThere was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\nbreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\nwasn't cut.\n\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \nclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \nright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \ntheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \nthe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \ncouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \neyes.\n\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\nthey should have, with their IDs.\n\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \nalready in the city.\n\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \nfamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \nnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\ngasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\nMicrodistrict 3.\n\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \nthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\nG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \nshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \ncarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \ncouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\nshe couldn't remember anyone's face.\n\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\nout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\nthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \nmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\ncase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\nthe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \npeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\nall from Kafan.\n\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \nwe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\nhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn't at home, my family and \nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \nthat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \nhead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \nsame time\n\nI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\nwasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\nexactly I can't say.                                                     \n\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \ndormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\n\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \nthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\nbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n\nI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \ncurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \nI can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \napartment.\n\nI don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You'll come in this entryway over my dead\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \neven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\nwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \ncouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \nstopped them.\n\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \nMaybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\ndidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\" \nOnly they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\n\nThat's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\nLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\nbut they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\ncourage to . . .\n\nA boy said to my mother \"Where's the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n\"What's happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \nfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\nher mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \nway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\nhappened in.\n\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \nless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\nlet's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \nlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\" I don't get it, all\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \nfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\nsays, \"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \nnight at someone else's.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \nshouts, \"Come back, they're coming!\" They didn't have enough time to get a \nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \nthey're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\nAsya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \nsomething like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \nthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren't you taking anything from this \napartment?\" He says, \"I don't need anything.\" And the women who were standing \nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \nmad, and he says, \"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\ndirection.\n\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \njust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \nshe didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \nthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n\nAfter that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \ndidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \nwho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \nthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \nstanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\nyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\nThat trick didn't work on them.\n\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \nthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \nAnd no one did anything. Anything.\n\n   April 25, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

    "context": "The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17\n    To the children of genocide: \"Send them away into the Desert\"\n\nThis is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish \nwartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders \nfor the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\n\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\n\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\n\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\n\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\n\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\n\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\n\t the people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [1]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the\n\t time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their\n\t lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [2]\n\n\t\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\n\n\t November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the\n\t orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their\n\t places of exile.\n\n\t \t\t\t\tAbdullahad Nuri. [3]\n\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\n\t opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\n\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\n\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\n\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\n\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\n\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\n\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\n\t special orphanages for them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat.\" [4]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\n\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\n\t to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with\n\t the caravans.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [5]\n\n\t\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows\n\t of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is\n\t not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by\n\t Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble\n\t in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned\n\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\n\t deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\n\t away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [6]\n\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\n\n\t\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\n\t its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\n\t it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\n\t shall die for it.\" [7]\n\n\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\nTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\n\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\n\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\na forgery. \n\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\n\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\n\n\t\t\t- - - references - - -\n\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\n\n[2] ibid, page 60\n\n[3] ibid, page 60\n\n[4] ibid, page 61\n\n[5] ibid, page 61\n\n[6] ibid, page 62\n\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\n    London), 1926, page 387\n\n",

    "context": "Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds\n\n  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency\n  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel\n  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato\n  Institute points out.\n\n    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,\n  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\n  dramatically.\n\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\n  of Seven nations.\n\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\n  overall U.S. economy.\n\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\n\n    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\n  reduce demand.\n\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\n  at the expense of the individual.\n\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nAvailable from:\n  Cato Institute\n  224 Second Street SE\n  Washington, DC  20003\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                        The Cato Institute\n\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\n    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\n  of the American Revolution.\n    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\n  civil liberties.\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\n  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,\n  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from\n  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,\n  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue\n  Code.",

    "context": "Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

    "context": "\n\nHere's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list\n\n\n10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\n\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\n     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about \n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\n\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\n     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\n     share!\n\n7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\n     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!\n\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!\n\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then\n     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\n\n4.   Make love, not War!\n\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.\n\n2.   See number 10.\n\n1.

Thus I've never really believed in God and\nheaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -\nI'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.\n        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how\nreligious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though\nI want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -\njust as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't\ndefinitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by\nreligious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to\nunderstand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.\n\n        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is\ncorrect?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian\nGod exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about\npeople who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -\nagnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their\nbeliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between\nthe religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do\nyou have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow\na different religion than you would if they were Christian??\n\n        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in\nthe bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be\nstories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??\n\n        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are\nfairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and\n'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find\nhard is the actual belief in God.\n\n        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite\nbelieve in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people.

Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational\n  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social\n  studies and other applications.

    "context": "THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?\n\n                   by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.\n                              (1894-1977)\n\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\n\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\n\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\n\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\n\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\n\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\n\n          How did this tomb become empty?\n\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\n     chimney at Christmas time.\n\n          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\n\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\n\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\n\n          The facts are these:\n\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\n\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\n     the wrong tomb?\n\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\n\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\n\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\n               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\n\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\n\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\n\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\n\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\n\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\n     the body of Jesus.\n\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\n     then proved.\n\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\n     of these men did.\n\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\n\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\n     what had happened to Him.\n\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\n\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\n\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\n     8).\n\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\n     appearances.\n\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\n\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\n\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\n\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\n\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\n\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\n     else had it.\n\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\n     us.\n\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\n\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\n     that His words are all true?\n\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\n\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\n\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.",

This makes it just\nabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is\nfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\n\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\nprevented the office from getting shot.\n\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\nfiring it.\n\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.",

But these were\nmiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - \"you've lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened\nto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!",

    "context": "\nOk.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well\nunder $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.\n\nIf you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to\nsee them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!

Hell's secret blend\nof canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman,\nyet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite\n*wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no \nmistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  \nTo shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above\nand beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that \nsuspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies\nseize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that\nwe are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.

    "context": "I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,\n     and the trumpet had blown.\nI dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment\n     before the white throne.\nOh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate.\nThey cried for the rock and the mountains.\nThey prayed, but their prayers were too late.\nThe soul that had put off salvation, \n\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.\n No time now to think of ....... religion,\" \nAlas, he had found time to die.\nAnd I saw a Great White Throne.\n\nNow, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for\nmotivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\" \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\ndarkness.\"  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \n\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men.\"\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever\nwont's.\"  ",

So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \n standard with the SE/30.\n\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\n from EGA/CGA etc. \nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch \n all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [\u00b2 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users\n server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.

[...]\n\nTranslation:  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future\nto Which You MUST Subscribe...\n\nFred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some\ndegree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done,\naddress it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.\n\nYou really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?\n  [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between\n   feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]\n\nT\n\nF\n\n*** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***\n\nI only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently,\ninstead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not\nleast of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is\nand is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last\npoint.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective\npoint-of-view?\n\nAnd, as usual, you defend your insults with \"he started it.\"  \"Yeah, I\ntook some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\"  \"So\nwhat if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\"  Besides that, I\nthink it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.\nSo your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of\nthe sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.\n\nYour defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \"I\nnever borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you\ngave it to me.\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded\nwith a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am\nnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly\ninterpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,\ncan I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that\nbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of\nyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.\n\n\n*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***\n\nToo bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you\nwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason\nto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations\nthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more\nmeaning than they ever should have had.\n\nMy reading of what Nick actually said is that \"people aren't required in\nall parts of all space processes\", so your taking issue with his opinions\nregarding people in the space program, I read as \"People are required in\nall parts of all space processes.\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm\nso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat\nyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and\nstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)\n\nThe point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd\nonly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your\njob, Fred.\n\nAnd, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,\nsimultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'\nthat only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that\nyou do as much as anyone.\n\n\nNo, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made\nyou imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though\nit's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as\ndense as myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?\n\n\nWho cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw\nme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.\nIf you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went\ndown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's\njust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's\nno worse than your own.\n\nLet's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,\nwhile your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my\ncomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling\nisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might\nsee it better, Fred.\n\n\"Net.ghod wannabe\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my\nmotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as\nyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about\npeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to\nimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private\nmail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a\njerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.\nAlas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and\nbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable\npurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried\nto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to\ncommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.\n\nWell, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job\nwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,\nI just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't\nhave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick\nor Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\\\ As the radius of vision increases,\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\\\ the circumference of mystery grows.",

    "context": "I saw this article posted in a local newsgroup.  I haven't seen it,\nor any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups\nwhich I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it,\ncheck it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these\nsorts of things.\n\nI have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this\narticle, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in\nlight of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand\nit is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register\na car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards,\nwiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in\nthe wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps\nsuggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from\nacquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs\nany possible benefits, IMO.\n\nBTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been\npromoting, in an even more disturbing form.\n\nThat said, with no further comment, the article follows:\n\n------------ Begin included article ---------\n\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\n\n\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\n\n\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\nenforcement.\n\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n----------- End included article ----------- \n",

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n\t\n\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n\t{\n\t\tint             answer;\n\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\n\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\n\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t\texit(0);\n                }\n\t}\n\n\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the \nMotif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of \ndialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \n\"Help\" or equivalents:\n\n  int AskUser(w, string)\n        Widget          w;\n        char           *string;\n  {\n        int             answer=RET_NONE;\t/* some not-used marker */\n        Widget          dialog;\t\t\t/* could cache&carry, but ...*/\n        Arg             args[3];\n        int             n = 0;\n        XtAppContext    context;\n\n        n=0;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,\n                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;\n        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtManageChild(dialog);\n\n        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);\n        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {\n                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */\n        return answer;\n  }\n\n\tThe dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same \nfunction when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user \nfinally selects one of those choices:\n\n  void response(w, client, call)\n        Widget          w;\n        XtPointer client;\n        XtPointer call;\n  {\n  int *answer = (int *) client;\n  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;\n        switch (reason->reason) {\n        case XmCR_OK:\n                *answer = RET_YES;\t/* some #define value */\n                break;\n        case XmCR_CANCEL:\n                *answer = RET_NO; \n\t\tbreak;\n        case XmCR_HELP:\n                *answer = RET_HELP;\n                break;\n        default:\n                return;\n        }\n}\n\nand the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and\ncontinues from there.\n\n[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contrib\nWidgetWrap library. 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?\nI have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\n\n\tUsers of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which \nwill work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\n\n\tIf you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do \nwhat you want.

Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take\nthe following steps to avoid the error:\n\n1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.\n2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.\n3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.\n4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the\nimage from the pixmap.\n5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and \nthe x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you \nthe parts of the pixmap which aren't good.\n6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.\n\n[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\n\n\tA number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight\ncharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is\nrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\n\t\n\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\n\tif (display)\n\t\t{ do X stuff }\n\telse\n\t\t{ do curses or something else }\nwhere display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following\n-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case \nXOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].\n\nThis is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line \nargument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is \nadequate. [5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 128)  How do I make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing?\nIs it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\n\n\tThe easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is \nas large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel \nwindow and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other \napplication. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n\t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec. You will then be able to exit the parent.\n\tAlternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file \ndescriptor to be closed on exec.\n\t\t(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);\n\n[Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman \n(gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?\n\n\tNo. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical \nsections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\n\n\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?\n\n\n\tYou are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code \nwould appear after window was created and mapped:\n  while (!done)\n    {\n      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);\n      switch (the_event.type) {\n\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\n\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t...\n\t}\n    }\n\n\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't \nset up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background \ncolors, so this program could previously include this code:\n  ...\n  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,\n                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);\n  ...\n \nNote: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is \nblack and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the \noriginal pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. \n[courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?\n\t\n\tA completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly\nwindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n\t- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n\t- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\n\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue \nfields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is \nfull-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn't work. \n\n\tXGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n\tThe initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?\nMy program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root.

You can try setting \nthe minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. \n[1/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?\n\n\tIt's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself\n[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- \nimagine the conflict between two such programs running.  \n\tThe only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack\nis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily\nassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do \nthis infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup \nmenus or other short parameter-setting windows).\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?\n\n\tThere is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\n\n\tUsers of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \nget notification of double-clicking.\n\tThere is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\n\t\n\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\nlibraries.\n\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by \nhand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \nXPutImage(); more specifically:\n\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\n\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\n\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\n\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \n\t\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n\t\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n\t5) render I2\n\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\n\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\n\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\nglyph.\n\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\n\n\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\nother reasons for this situation.\n\n\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\n\n\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur'an\"\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\nfact which contradicts your theory. \n\n\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\nthis.\n\n\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\n\n\nHere too.\n\n\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\nhave.",

A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.

I mess with this older\nstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)\n\n     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be\ncompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  \n\n    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read \neither :     62-000042-015 or\n             62-000094-0x2\n\n     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.\n\n\n    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between\npins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.\n\n\n    Looks right.\n  \n[art deleted]\n\n\n      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have\nto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.\n\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.\n\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's\njust hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).\n\n                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--  \n                  --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  \n\n\n\nFrom chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993\nReceived: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)\n\tid AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500\nReceived: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)\n\tid m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT\nMessage-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za>\nFrom: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

Numerous articles in major newspapers \n(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested \nthe existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the \nNazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to \ndeal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his \ndeeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt \nobliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.\nConcurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' \nor face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger \nArmenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration \nas deplorable but insignificant.[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'\n    E.

The \n magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany\n and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the\n magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,\n is attention-getting.\n\n This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically\n important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be\n an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. \n\n In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain\n political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They \n occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.\n The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered \n \"Aryan\" and what befell them.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nSource: \"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\" by Avetis Aharonian.

    "context": "Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-\ntheory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist \nsupport?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People \nare incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the\neventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People\nbegin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children\nand robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale\nof Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his \nconclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these\nidiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.\n\n\n\n\nActually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating\nskills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.\n\nI would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated \npolitical power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \"right\" things\n(where \"right\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)\nis showing an acute case of \"myopic social perspective\", not to mention\narrogance and utter stupidity.\n\nLimbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established\nbody politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of\nvirtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination\nof local control over Affairs Public.  \n\nPerhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated \nlike errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic \npeople who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \"oughta-be's\"\ninside their own hopelessly closed minds.\n\n\n\n\nOK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific\nincident.\n\n\n\n\nHmmm, \"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,\nnor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  Liberal translation: \"the\nfederal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local\nschool districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,\nwhile prohibiting others.\"\n\nI think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing\nfor LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.\n\nNice job on the specificity of that one, too.\n\n\n\n[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] \n\n\nAh yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you\nmay be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it\nprimarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences\nof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of\nconspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\ngood fortune?\n\n\n\n\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\nand business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\n\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\"\nat all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\nmillions out of racism.\n\n\n\n\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\n\n\n\n\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\ntreated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.\n\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and\nneeded to be exterminated.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\n\n\n\n\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\njust a wee bit here.\n\n\n\n\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\nindustry here.\n\n\n\nJust a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \nof Hollywood.\n\n90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full\nof mush\" hyperbole indicates.\n\n\n\n\nPretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for\ngovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\nIndication here that \"Elements of the Media\" (since career is a self-selected\ncategorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in\nthe populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.\nNo insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only\nthat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the\nsituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.\n\nYou may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable \nopinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his \naudience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that \npurports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree \nor other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who \nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\n\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\noppose government control of the media.\n\n\n\n        \n\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\nwho disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology\non an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?\nPerhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that\nthey exist in your mind, not the real world.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\n\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\nin America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\nin grade school.\n\n\n\n\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\nracism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \nLeft.\n\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\n\n\n\nThis is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn't it?\n\n\nMatt Freivald\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiBORGalism:\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

For\nexample: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space\nworld didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it\npossible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely\nimpersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of\nlife -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent\nindicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be\nfound *outside* that world, in its Source.\n\n\n\nWhen you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are\npresenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one\nthe requires a kind of \"faith\" too.   By taking such a hard line in\nyour atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.\n\nBut before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope\nyou'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by\nreading Paul Johnson's \"A History of Christianity\".  From your remarks,\nit seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian\nreligion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in\nMan to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and\nbe animated by some enduring values.\n\nWith best wishes,",

I suppose one could hold compromise as\nbeing an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else\ninsists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?\n\n\nAlmost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing\nover another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those\naspects which justify a desired action or belief.

PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.",

But here's a brief summary...\n\nPHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many\ndevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take\nadvantage of a 3D extension to X called \"PEX\".  PEXlib is a slightly\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\nextension to X.\n\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n- Is free of \"policy\"\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\n\nIf you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that\nboth API's have a lot in common.",

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\nour lives into \"before\" and ''after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\nlosses and everything that happened.\n\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \nthose who didn't.\n\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was\nnear and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\n\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\nlike it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a \nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\n\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \nexpected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out \nof the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\"\n\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \nme. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \nwas thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to \nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\nexcited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They \ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \nroom. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\n\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, \nthey don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \nyour children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your \nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people \namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm \na teacher.\n\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \nhim in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \nbut a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were \ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \nMamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I'm old enough to \nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he's being held, \nMamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, \nwho's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \nmustn't do it. She said, \"Come on, let's straighten this out, without \nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \ncame here to kill them.\"\n\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \ndidn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\n\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\ndid to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \nthey beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but \ndidn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \nkicking her, using anything they could find.\n\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, \njust didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let's take her \noutside.\"\n\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \nweren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't \nafraid of what would happen to them.\n\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \nwith blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \nI were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm \nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold \na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, \nand I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\n\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\nhe's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \nI felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I \njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the \nground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\n\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't \nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth \nliving.\n\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \nalthough, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that \nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \nforget it.\n\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\n\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to \nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it \nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \nfrom the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, \n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\n\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even \nremember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\nthere by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell \nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad \nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\n\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \nneighbors.\n\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\n \nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \nsure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone \nsaid, \"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a \nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember\nwhose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \tI having opened my \neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \nbeen beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only \nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \nI can't remember anything more.\n\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot \nabout him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\nif he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \nUfa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \nall out later.\n\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \nof the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is \nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \ndidn't want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \nentirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting \nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. \nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the \ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone \nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.\n\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's \nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm \na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, \nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. \nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\n\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \nand money in your apartment we'll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \nover and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one \nanother right then.\n\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, \nhalfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, \nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\n\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \nthreshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\n\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \nwas already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \nthat all of that would die with me.\n\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \ndidn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\nI would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \nor not. He said, \"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" In the third \nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \nalready taken the other.\n\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\nThat's just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I'll drive\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\nand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \nThat's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\n\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. \nMarina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \nneighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\n\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What's the mat-\nter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \nhe couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \ntold him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\ngood terms with them.\n\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \nopened the door and immediately said, \"I'm an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \nLet her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\nabout this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \nto go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \nwho's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \nstill there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n\nI went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \ndon't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \nAnd again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \nhad never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \nI tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\n\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\nchildren's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \nAll these years I've been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \n\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\nleft.\n\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \nvery often.\n\n\t\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

    "context": "Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\n\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\ncan help a little.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are\noff-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,\nbeing targeted directly at the VR application developer.

There may be other such \nsoftware packages available.\n\nX11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running\nX11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and \nis based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. \n\nIt seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there\nwill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various \nsorts of hardware.\n\nFollowups directed to comp.windows.x",

There is such\na wide variation between people with respect to what causes their\nheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned\nabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.\n\nI don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).\nDehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before\nplaying rather than after.\n\nBeing in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.\n\nI've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in \ndescending order of importance):\n\n1) Heavy exercise\n2) Sleep deprivation\n3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast)\n4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonk)\n\nHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I \ndon't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of \nthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered \nthis, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two \nor three years when I get cocky (\"It's been so long, maybe I just don't \nget them anymore\") and stop being careful.\n\nHope this is helpful.",

    "context": "Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM",

    "context": "I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have\nsome comments to share.\n\nThe story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get\nthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!",

    "context": "Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,\nwith Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.\nMy opinion, FWIW, to all:\n\nMark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

He has a total, major and minor,\nEQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF\n(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the\npotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15\nbest hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching\nhis \"prime\" season of 27.

I don't know if it\nis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the\nmail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a\nUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail\nis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.\nMost messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail\non the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.\nWhere ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header\nthen a message saying \"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\".

    "context": "\nYep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:",

Dr. Azmi Suslu, \"Russian View on the Atrocities Committed\n        by the Armenians Against the Turks,\" Ankara Universitesi, Ankara,\n        1987, pp. 45-53.\n        \"Document No: 77,\" Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 10, Drawer \n        No: 4, File No: 410, Section No: 1578, Contents No: 1-12, 1-18.\n        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander\n        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,\n        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)\n\n\"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the\n liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the\n allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of\n the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic",

    "context": " \n: [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n \n: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \n: (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would\nnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,\nbut it seems many Christians do not read these groups. \n\nPetri\n",

Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights.\"\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling.\"\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\nare over.\n\nSerdar Argic",

I'm not.\n\n\nYou must understand that this is because Christians often forget to\ntreat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are\nhuman and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I\nhope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.

If lots of n-6 FAs are\nconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid\nproducts to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\"\nIsn't this ratio the issue?\n\nWhat's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days?

How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\n\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\n\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\ndoubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \"can't\" is a\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\n\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\nevery person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\n\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\nisn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\nsecrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why\nour companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \n\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\nfraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.\n\nDon't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\nthe escrow databases.\n\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\nsecret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\nClipper chips.\n\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\ndoesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\nthat they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\n\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\nit all.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com",

They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having\ncopayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look\nmore like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and \nhospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)\ndisappears, as they were there before it appeared.\n\n\nFor one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...\n\n\nMost of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are\na player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the\nhealth insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but\nhealth insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being \nspent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;\n\nOHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind\nof health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.\n\n\nSome of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of\nAmerican companies, and their parents provide full insurance down\nhere.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV\nto see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in\nbasic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after\nhaving gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them-\nselves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras \nfor those people who \"deserve it\".\n\n\nI agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems\nthat they have won bigger, when you look at how full their coffers\nare.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out\nfor job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON,\n(Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense\nprivileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.\n\ngld",

Au contraire;\nhe was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't\nall-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when\neveryone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy\nCampanella. \n\n\n  Which reports are those? \n\n\n  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play\nhim IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.\nRight now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez\nwill be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they\nplay up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching\ntandem.  \n\n\n  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher\ndefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from\nyour viewpoint or mine.

This is\nNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist\nby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the\ngovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the government\nshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

    "context": "\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\nI don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\n\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\n       \nRegards,",

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\nrequires work on our part.\n\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\noneself about believing in the first place.  \n\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\ndoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\nJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  ",

Macchiavelli, as translated by\nDaniel Donno.]\n\n\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\nwill allow.\n\n\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \n\n\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\n\n\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\nhis original domain.\n\n\t...",

You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes.

Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables.

I thought I'd post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What's New\" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......",

Otherwise we would have the book\nof Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the \napocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  \n\n\nIII. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because\n \t\tthey teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)\n \t\tparts of the canon.\n \n \tthen I answer: \n \t\tThese is a logically invalid *a priori*. \n \t\tBesides, we are talking about OT texts- \n \t\twhich in many parts are superceded by the NT\n \t\t(in the Xtian view). Would not this same\n \t\tprinciple exclude _Ecclesiastes_?\n \t\tThis principle cannot be consistently applied.\n \nI have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one\nvoice, and he does not contradict himself.  \n\nThe ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired\nby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more\nguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided\nthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books\nsuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,\nthe Lutheran hymn \"Now Thank We All Our God\" quotes a passage\nfrom this book.\n\nThe deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's\nhistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the\nrest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these\nbooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

Chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my \ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\n\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\n\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.\n\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\n\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\n\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\n\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\nreligious community.\n\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\npew in front of us.\n\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\n\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\n\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\nwith her again.\n\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader\nof this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)\n\nThanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.\n\nDrew\n",

It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.

In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \n",

(Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\nin North America.\n\n\nI'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\nworld.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those\nplayers were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and\nSjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to\ncome, I wouldn't have it any other way.",

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\nestablished in the self.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\nbeginning of transcendental life.\n\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\n\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\nBooks of A.C.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the \"So-and-so is a thief\"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical\n    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.\n\n\n    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron\n    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro\n    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

Scum has no guilt or freedom to\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes\nfor Dr. Gunn.\n\n: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that\n: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any \n: assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\n: to help these children after birth?\n: \n\nHere's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\nmoral decisions based on reality.\n\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\n\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\n\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\nwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.\n\n: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real\n: good guess.\n: \n\nAnd, it's probably right.\n\n: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.\n: \n\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\n\"responsibility\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\nenough to make us \"feel responsible\" without showing anything that\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \"feel\" like\ngood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give\nme the freedom to say \"I'm good\", and the rest of the world can burn.\nRape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where\npoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister\nif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,\nbecause it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church\nbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.\nBut, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love\nmyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that\na man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \"christian\".\n\nAt the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\n\nWe've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible\nto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or\nto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\nof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will\nhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the\nbiggest blessing this world can hope to see.\n\nWhy do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"",

Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--",

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the\ndifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I\nwould think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.\n\n\n                                    -Sean\n\n",

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators\nof crimes no more represent the \"Black community\" than racist hateful Whites\nrepresent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities\nwho have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe\notherwise). The trap is the easy way out.\n\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\n\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\nhumans.\n\tIt's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\nthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\nriot!\n\tIn closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\ncourse of denial and repression.\n\tI wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\nluck in avoiding the \"trap\". \n\tPeace, my brother.\n\t\t\tm.\n-- \n\n\n",

If my experiences say that \"there exists no god\"\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\nrealities.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with \"feelings and experiences\" is that they\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\nam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\n\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\n\n\nYou must be using a definition of \"evidence\" that I am not familiar with.\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\nwhat you are saying is true.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\nindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts\nbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians\ndo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of\nthese things can go.\n\n\nAt the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, \nthe trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY\nclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best\nevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it\nshould read \"for explaining the non-existence of God\").  So not only\nmust you \"prove\" your own case, you have to \"disprove\" theirs.\n\n(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\nof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)\n\n\nI know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.\nI just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes\nwithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct\nme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the \nnon-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made\nsome progress towards the truth.\n\n",

He's kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\nBooks, Inc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\nDC  20006.\n\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America's visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"",

Basically,\nthe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be\nrealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds\nof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.\nTherefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common\ninflammation should be avoided.

    "context": "\n:   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying\n: the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper.\n: I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here\n: using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the\n: modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\n\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\n\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\n\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\n\n\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\n\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.\n\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\n   are losing data, you may be advised that \"you need to upgrade to a\n   16550\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\n   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\n   my own problem had never heard the term \"16550\" and many didn't even\n   know what a UART was.\n\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\n   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\n   by themselves.\n\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\ncard.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\n\n\nThe Hardware Situation.\n\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\ndiagnostic program \\WINDOWS\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\n\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\n\nSo, what UART component do you have?\n\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with\nthe numbers \"8250\" or \"16450\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\nand you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\nCOM board.\n\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \"N\" chip is the normal 40-pin\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\nchips without the \"A\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\n\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\nChips&Technology:       82C607\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\nVLSI                    16C550\nTurboCom warns about the pre-\"A\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\n\nIf you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\n\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\n\nJDR Microdevices\n2233 Samaritan Drive\nSan Jose  CA  95124\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\n\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the \"+\" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit\nISA card providing:\n\nPort Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments\nCOM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nCOM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nParallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7\nGame       ribbon\n\nThe kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM\nport, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for\nthe ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can\nbe individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,\nDCD, and DSR jumpers.\n\nJDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.\n\nI have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards\nwith 16550s:\n\nTSD Systems\n(407) 331-9130\n$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.\n\nGreenfield Trading and Distributors\n(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).\nTheir card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.\n\nR&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.\n820 East Highway 434\nLongwood, FL  32750\nPHONE: (407) 331-1424\nFAX: (407) 331-8606\n2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39\n\nI have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\n\n\nThe Software Situation\n\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\ndrivers have the following limitations:\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\n   be effective.\n - The API won't accept rates above \"CBR_128000\".\n - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\n - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\n - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\n\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\nRumors suggest they \"may\" be solved in Windows \"4.0\".\n\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\na copy of \"TurboCom\", current version 1.2, from:\n\nBio-Engineering Research\nPacific CommWare Division\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\n(503) 482-2744 voice\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\nMCImail:    344-5374\nCompuServe: 71521,760\n\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\nbut as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\n\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\n\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\n\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\nengineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\n115,200 may still be risky.\n\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \"Windows Sources\" magazine.\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a \"power user\" whose\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\n\n\nClosing Soapbox Comments\n\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\nI/O.\n\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \"sort of\"\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\n\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\n\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

    "context": "[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\n\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\n\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\"\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto \"support GOAL's position\" on \"all bills.\"\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\"\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\"\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\nFID's,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- ",
