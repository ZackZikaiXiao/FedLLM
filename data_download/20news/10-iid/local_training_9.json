    "context": "\nMay I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may\nnot use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the\nsame message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find\nthe precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also\nrealize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only*\nbut he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact\nintentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_\nstill stands as the \"Bible\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian\nNational movement!\n\n\n\nAs a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT\ninfluenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above,\njust a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar\nconclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB\ndoes not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share\nmy views.\n\n\nWhat 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same\n\"situation\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the\nJews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of\nQu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for\nyou... get into the \"soc.culture.arabic\" newsgroup where the posters have been\ndebating the topic \"Jews in the Qu'ran\" (and may I remind you the people doing\nthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).\nYou will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put\nit lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will\nbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think\nthe 1948-1967 \"situation\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you\nthink?\n\n\nAll I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \"Jews in the Qu'ran\" and\nthink again.  \"Freedom of choice\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic\nlaw especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure\nyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic\nstate).\n\n\nProbably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren\nthat the _Covenant_ is \"null and void\" without getting assassinated himself!\n\n\nIn conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian\nNational Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath\nLibrary DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I\nwas doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back\nfrom you soon!\n\n- Mike\n\n---\n       MI     KE   MIK    EMIK   EMI  K        \"Opinions expressed above\n       M I   K E  M   I  K        E   M         are my own and not that\n       M  I K  E  MIKEM  I  KEM   I   K         of 'Big Blue'\"\n       M   I   K  E   M   IKE M  IKE  MIKE",

    "context": "\n\n\n\nNow this is getting interesting!\n\nI was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated\nthis Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some\nreason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the\nresurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean\nthe raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:\n\n1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was \npretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right\nnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \"soul\"\n(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?\n\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\nphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my\nnew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal\nso it can be tortured for all eternity?\n\n3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical\nplace to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?\nDo you think we could find it if we dig?\n\nMark Schnitzius\nschnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu\nUniv. of Central Florida\n\n[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I\nthink the most common view is that final disposition does not occur\nuntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the\nmeantime, some believe that people \"sleep\" until the final\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\nThere are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.\n\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\ndifferent \"technology\" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that\nthere are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,\nbut I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't\nthink I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some\nanalog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the\nearth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension,\noutside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little\nin the way of details.",

The biggest\nproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.\n\nIn almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets\nwith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you\ncan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they\nwere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory\nperiodically.\n\nWith modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be\nless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer\nrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their\nequipment.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n\t100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n\tnot SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n\treferences.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're\n\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the\n\t'reply' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone\n\twill get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n\t(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas.

Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as \nwe know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh \nas a reminder. \n\nSeems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those\nprotected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't \nhave a good idea yet what \"being shielded by the seals\" actually involves \nor how exactly it relates to salvation.

If not, also good. If God wants\nto save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way.

The tour of the Bible I've taken in \nstudying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-\nwarding.

Like\nso many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.\n\nI strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I\ndeign from commenting much further.\n\n\nNow hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\n \n\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \ndistinction is subtle yet important.\n\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\n\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\nmuch beyond that.\n\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \nabandon these absolutes.\n\n\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does\nnot mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to \nrender all doubts unreasonable.\n",

    "context": "According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \"in X's\nname\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized\nto conduct business \"in John's name\" had full authority over John's\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n\"in John's name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus' name\" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus' name\" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus' name\" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus' Name\" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\nomniscience and grace.\n\nVan Kelly\nvek@research.att.com\n",

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368",

The original article\nhas reappeared, so:\n\n    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring\n    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\n    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone\n    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\n    enforcement.\n\nHmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on\nordinary landlines.\n\n    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nBut the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will\nbe applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop\npeople listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't\neven be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's\nmisfortunes).\n\nYes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear\nwhen the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary\nconversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable\nas at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone\nlines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.\n\nMy apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it\nclear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of\nobfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise\n(IMHO).\n\n\nBTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any\nreplies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?

The system for the\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\nfor the other 40-bit key.\n\nSimilarly, it didn't say \"We're making encryption is commercially available.\"\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\n\nThe next thing it didn't say is \"We're making encryption legal\",\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\nPresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\n\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\n\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\n\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\nwhich clearly means \"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\nSoon.  Once business buys into this.\"\n\nAnother thing it didn't say is \"We're going to ask Congress for money\nto do *lots* more wiretapping\", because of course, there's a budget crisis,\nand Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\n   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct\n   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\n   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\nwhich means \"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\n(that's what \"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\" \nmeans.)

'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the\n  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\n\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\ninterpretation.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\n\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\n\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\nmilitias mean?\"\n\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\n\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).\n\n   \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not\n   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of\n   resistance ?

Who would\nhave thought?\n\n\n\tI remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\n\n\n\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\n\n\n\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\nweapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\n\n\n\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\ntank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\n\n\n\tThis I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\n\n\n\tI'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\nso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\n\n\n\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\nI'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\nlocal troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\nI suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\n\n\n\tSo would I, but the resources often aren't available to\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\nthan anything else.\n\n\n\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\ntrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\n\n\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\nother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\nfor these functions.",

He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.

So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.",

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.

    "context": " \n: There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\n: that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri\n",

    "context": "\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof \"reason and observation.\"\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?\n\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\n\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\n\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\n\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\n\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\n  to the mid-60's.\n\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\n\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\n\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\n  networks.\n\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\n\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\n  classified.\n\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\n\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\n\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\n  brute-force search is impractical.\n    \n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\n\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\n\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\n  probably strong.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\n    \n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\n\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\n\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\n  doesn't have a chance.\n\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\n  [KAH67].\n  \n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?",

Even then getting\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\n\n\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\nthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\n\n   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\n   hyperspace :-)\n\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...",

    "context": "\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call.

I would conclude that science does not have its\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails.

It is my habit to check my articles before and\nafter their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:\n \n \nI was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\nconfused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\nland discussed.

(Although I am researching CHORION a little).\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.

Thus we find this demand on his part for\nquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nGood point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\ndeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\n \nDB...\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\noften enough:\n \n \nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\npresented no use of:\n \n(d) historical context                or\n(e) historical content                or\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\n(g) cultural context                  or\n(h) cultural content                  or\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]\n \nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\nshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\n \nDB...\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\n \n \nMY REPLY...\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\nanother.\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look\nat your defense of this later.\n \nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\nsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,\nthat's the first criteria we must examine.\n \nDB...\n\"This included:\n \n    \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\" by Woodward and Zuck\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhich I own.  It's a good source of commentary info.  But not inerrant.\n \nDB...\n    \"The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible\" by Laydon\n    \"The one volume Bible Commentary\" by J R Dunelow\n    \"Word meanings of the Testament\" Ralph Earl\n    \"The Abingdon Bible Commentary\" published by Abingdon\n    \"Harpers Bible Commentary\" by William Neal\n     (Actually I could have presented many more as well)\n \nMY REPLY...\nI appreciate your doing this research, Dave.  Maybe we are getting somewhere\nin how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth\nstudy.\n \nDB...\n\"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation\nof Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGreek word \"apagchw\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nNo you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly\nprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he\nwas buried in his father's tomb.\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nNotice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\nresult.\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n \nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\nmeans \"hang oneself\".\n \nDB...\n\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^above, mine]\n\"Reputable\"?  You mean ones that have never erred?\nAs far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,\neven by me. ^^^^^^^^^\n \nAs I said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nAlthough I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable\nexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),\nI've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.\n \nMAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\nBlood to this day.\n \nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\nhanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\nother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\netc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that\n                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMatthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ncut.\n^^^\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nI also wrote...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nMY REPLY...\n \nHere we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.\nLet's look at the passage in Matthew:\n \nMAT 27:4 saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" And they said,\n\"What is that to us? You see to it!\"\n \nMAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself.\n \nMAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \"It is not\nlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\"\n \nMAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,\nto bury strangers in.\n \nMAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \nNotice verse 5...\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\"\nMatthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a\nresult of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWhat does Acts say?\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\n \nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nHere we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of\nreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \"two\" accounts of Judas'\ndeath is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsay Judas \"hanged himself\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the\nhanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHowever, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no\ncontradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.\n \n.......\n \nMY REPLY...\n...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records\nhis death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging\nand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be\nthe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a\n                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nresult of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n______________________________________________________________________\n \nI quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but\nin looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\n \nDB...\n\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\nexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\npost gave us some...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.

Of course a Biblical inerrantist\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\nprophesy of the Potter's field came from).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\nthis with you.\n \nDB...\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.  What do you think, Dave?\n \nDB...\n\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\n\nFrank",

We are going to buy three of\nthem with 17\" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will\nimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and\neither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.\n\nDo not buy a 486SX sytem.\n\nMy personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When\nyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they\nget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large\nsteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX\nmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.",

Papers addressing the theme will\nconsider questions such as\n\tWhat is needed for application construction by non-programmers?\n\tCan we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?\n\tIs it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to\ncreate new widgets?\n\tShould widgets and applications be able to print themselves?\n\nYour participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate\non the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including\n\n\tapplications\n\texperience with users\n\tnew objects\n\treviews of and proposals for revision of \n\t\tinternal Andrew protocols\n\nWe expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would\nlike to do a demonstration.  \n\nPaper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.\nAcceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.\n\nSend papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.",

Reguarding image\nquality and resolution - I have not seen much better.\n\nFor those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here\nis how to put it back together.\n\t1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files\n\t2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer\n\t   in each file.\n\t3. concatinate all the parts into a single file\n\t4. uudecode the file\nThere are tools available to do this without the hassle such as\nuuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post\nthese tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know.\n------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------\nbegin 644

    "context": "What an exciting thread (finally!)\n\nMitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu\n mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence\n worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is\n the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by\n soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-\n antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and\n grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.\n\nWorship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.\n\nHundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman\n Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of\n Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship\n was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership\n in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in\n ancient times is fascinating!\n\nOh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.\n\nI am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the\n Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels\n of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns\n in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure\n that they had Mithraic significance or not.\n\nI don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the\n Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.\n\nSomeone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More\n likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed\n by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all\n throughout even up to France bigtime.",

Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n\nYou are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the\nfoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.\nSee B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.",

Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,\nwider and slightly banked. \n\nExample: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)\nand I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south\neast becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the\nleft strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled\ninto the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't \na car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.\nNow my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and \nover 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then\nthat I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he \nhad just turned the corner and was just noticing me.

Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\n\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\n\nThe fixer smiled.....",

Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive\norder chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?\n\nOn the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence\nwith multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs\nprohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal\nSecurity Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit\ntelevision.  More paranoia.\n\nThese are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?\n\nDo you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese\nhad been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?\n\nOr maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about\ntheir Engima with respect to Turing and the British.\n\nHow about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little\nmore paranoia have helped the Germans here?\n\nMaybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about\nEmma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...\n\nMaybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation\nwith the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic\nSecrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?\n\nThe most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was\nthe one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating\nevidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system.\nSoviet paranoia, right?\n\nAnd what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And \nhuge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near\nsatellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.\n\nWhen I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time\neven with a \"secret\" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet\nand the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very*\nthick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?\n\nI could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as\nbest hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as\nit can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the\npattern of facts and conclude that they were random...\n\nAnd we know the government is violent -- even against children as\nrecent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace\nbut a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence\nthat our government institutions have in their contempt for our\ncivil rights.\n\nAnd of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of\ncaution because that does much less harm than erring on the\nreckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.\n\nI might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and\nBamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to\nsupport your sheepish acquiescence to authority.\n ",

The characters appear to be too closely\nspaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the \nrightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the \nrightmost edge of the second character, and so on.

We Catholics\ndo believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in\nthe Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church.\nIt should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as\nSacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions.\nHowever, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to\nthe Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine,\nended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can\nbe added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications\nthat were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could\ndefine statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation\nthat were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed\nbefore the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at\nany subsequent council.\n\nCardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_,\nwritten while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of\nof this point.

If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n\"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles.

The\nNames have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent\n(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of\nyour name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against\nyou. Read 'em and weep. \n\nWe tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What's a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?

Quist   DoD #94\n\n\n[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \n\n(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens\nreferring to each other as \"Chuck\". I guess you had to be there. I\nwasn't.) \n\nChuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\n to live a man's life,\n[Music slowly builds in background]\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\n and the deepest valleys,\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\n doing donuts and evading the police;\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\n\n\tI Want to be      A Denizen!\n\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\nfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of\nan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels\nsit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,\nshowering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil\non the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of \"The Lumberjack Song\"]:\n\nI'm a Denizen and I'm okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe's a Denizen and he's okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n'Cause He's a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He's a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That's sick!\", or\nperhaps \"That's sick! I want!\"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says \"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Over $5500  [Arnie]\n \n                        Organized (?) Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

The teams of Palestinian-Israel\nMorals Patrols, or PIMPS, would receive a percentage of the financial\nincome in order to encourage their participation and add to their\nincentive in locating suitable candidates.\n\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nShouldn't that be insemination?\n\n",

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"",

    "context": "Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy.\"\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:",

It's one\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\n\n       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \nthemselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\nthe evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\npeople jump off buildings.)\n\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn't mean they\nweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\nkid might.\n\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\nkilled.\n\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\nbusinesses.)\n\n\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I\nwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\n\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\nit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\n",

I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\n* What is Snefru?\n\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n\n  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and\n  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally\n  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\n  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\n  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\n  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\n  same hash.\n\n  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\n  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\n  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\n  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\n  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\n  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\n  signature can do the same thing.\n\n  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\n\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n\n  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\n  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\n  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\n  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\n  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\n  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\n  if and only if X = H(M).\n\n  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\n  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\n  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\n  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\n  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\n  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\n\n  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\n  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\n  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\n  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend\n  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing\n  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.\n\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\n\n  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.\n  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is\n  available from [FTPMD].\n\n  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft\n  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some\n  people refer to it as MD5.\n\n* What is Snefru?",

    "context": "Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White\nHouse Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a\ntough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of\nresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are\nserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\nBill 266 in 1991.\n\nPossible actions to take in response:\n\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\nmore.\n\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \n\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\n\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\n\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\nexpenses and lobbying.\n\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\nmeetings on it.\n\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\ntools for these purposes. \n\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to\nanalyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it\nmodified.\n",

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.",

When\n   >you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident\n   >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.\n   >\n\n     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to\n     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\novertime of playoff games).\n",

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)\nAs far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult\nto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:\n  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out \n    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own\n    breathing effort (let alone anything else)\n\n  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is\n    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled\n    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n",

He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.\n\n\n\nNot.  \n\nSmith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better \nthan anyone else ever has.\n\nYount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't \nnoticed.\n\nOne of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.\n\n\n\nLike whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near\nas goos as the guys you're running down.\n\n\nThat's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the \nHall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been\nexcellent.\n\n\nNo, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?\nNot really.  But he obviously belongs there.\n\nThe Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As \nmore players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  \n\nAnd, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,\netc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability\nthroughout most of his career.\n\nOf course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know\nwhat you mean.  \n\nAs for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters\ntend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't\nlead MLB history in walks allowed, either.",

    "context": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\nnot white power.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================\n\n",

In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\nStuff\" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them\nto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\naround the network.\n\n\n                                Finding Stuff\n\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n",

I never would have expected him in the\n#1 spot.\n\nIt's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first\nand second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points\nhigher in both leagues than any other year.\n\nLooks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.\n\nHighest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin\nMitchell :->.\n\nThe other elite fielders in the league.\n\nThis is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\nthird.\n\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\n\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know\nwhat happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low\n1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988\n(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.\n\nStrange last two years.\n\nAccording to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.\nBut at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).\n\nBoggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every\nother year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.\n\nLast year -- a fluke or a portent?\n\nWhy is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close\nto one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?\n\nBrook  is declining.\n\nThree first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies\ngets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while\nat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder\nat third.\n\nZeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about\n10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\n\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\n\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total\nof one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.\n\nHoward Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,\nHoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break\nthe .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.\n\nGood hitter, but his fielding needs work.\n\nNot a good fielder.\n\nBoth are better off at shortstop.\n\nTwo consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to\nhave helped his fielding any.  \n\nTexas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest\nDA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.\n-- \nDale J.

When the girls fled, \n the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.\n     \n On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their\n pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents \n are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.\n     \n The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth\n escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur \n Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them \n against a wall, and put their arms around them.\n \n When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat\n him with the butts of their rifles.\n \n On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising\n Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the \n soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the \n beating.\n \n On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded\n him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As\n the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued\n dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.\n \n     The army said it was checking the reports.\n \n                ....................\n \n \n      ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM\n \n Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday \n to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.\n     \n Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in\n prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after\n soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.\n \n     ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy\n Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father\n George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.\n \n     Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of\n Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank\n and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.\n \n    Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation\n of requesting permits to reach holy sites.\n \n     Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement\n to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian\n celebrations.\n \n     ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.\n But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.\n \n     An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his\n identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.\n \n                   ...................\n \n              \n \n If you are as revolted at this as I am, drop Israel's best friend email and \n let him know what you think.\n \n \n           75300.3115@compuserve.com (via CompuServe)\n           clintonpz@aol.com         (via America Online)\n           clinton-hq@campaign92.org (via MCI Mail)\n \n \n Tell 'em ARF sent ya.\n \n                  ..................................\n \n If you are tired of \"learning\" about American foreign policy from what is \n effectively, Israeli controlled media, I highly recommend checking out the \n Washington Report.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give \nyour question a shot. \n\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\n\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \n\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or \nHP wouldn't sell many......\n\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\n\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like \na good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.

    "context": "I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my\nwife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \npresent to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.\n\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\n(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\nliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\npeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.\n\nSo we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\ngoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \nof God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?",

The Admirals\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.",

    "context": "\nFlights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.",

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to\n\tdevelop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise\n\tprobably become illegal pretty quickly here...\n\nIt's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed\nis a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec\nfunctions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.\n\nYou'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have\na good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the\nmiddle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on\na byte stream.\n\nWith v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. \nQuality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.\n\nAt the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible\nmodems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on\nthe cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get\nthe price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty\nhome RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought\nfor 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software\n(which I don't).\n\nThe reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -\nthe only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.\nEconomics, I'm afraid.\n\nHowever... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with\nthe bottleneck of a v32bis modem.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the\nperson claiming to be IT is obviously insane?\n\nI'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could\nsomebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that\nhe would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio\nbroadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.\n\nAnd, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have\nbeen hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting\nsomebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.\n\nSo I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be\nearly to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to\nbe credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.\n\n[Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' \nor 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. \nMark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and \nwonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. \nMark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand. \nMark 13:24    \"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be \ndarkened, and the moon will not give its light, \nMark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in \nthe heavens will be shaken. \nMark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with \ngreat power and glory. \n\nMy understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming,\nwhich was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's\ntelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen\nbefore his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his\npower openly visible.\n\nBy the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me\nthat he is claiming to be Christ.",

Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds.

Because his messengership is\nuniversal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that\nrelate to almost all species of creation.\n    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving\nwith many gifts in a city where various people live, will be\nwelcomed by a representative of each people who\nacclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language\nso, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of\nPre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the\nuniverse by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the\nearth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual\ngifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from\nthe realities of the whole universe, each species of\ncreation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human\nbeings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and\nacclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and\neach bearing one of his miracles.\n    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all\nhis miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\nas accurate reports.\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \n\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \ndeclaration of prophethood.  \n\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \n\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\nprophethood, and \n\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \n\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\nconduct and perfection, and \n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \nThe last part again has two branches:  \n\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \n\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \n\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \nthat occured during his mission either to break the \nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\nconsensus.  \n\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\n\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\n",

Can someone help me?\n\nUnfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into\nemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to\nchange the source code so that all of these special keys generated\ncharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier\nstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \"ESC [ 1 B 7\" \nwould indicate that the \"HOME\" key was pressed, with the shift key\ndown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\nas \"shift-Return\".\n\nIf anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\nin the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \nemacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods \nsomewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.\n\nNotes: \n\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \n   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.\n\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\n   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could \n   easily be adapted for anything else.\n",

(I can't speak\nauthoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they\nstarted running a \"Two Million Strong!\" campaign for a while -- but they\nlet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they\nsimply were never going to reach that level of membership.\n\nIn 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting\npoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  \nBy 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had \nabout a million.

    "context": "\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\nis only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \n\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's \"sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\n\n--Rex",

Note the early use of\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\n\n-- Eric\n\n\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\n\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\n\n\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\n\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\n\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\n\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\n\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,\n   England.  (Sorry, I don't have an ISBN# for this).\n\n2. An Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation.  Hopcroft, J\n   and Ulman, J.\n\n3. The C Programming Language. Kernighan, B and Ritchie, D.\n\n4. A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens, C.\n\n--------\n\nFrom: td@alice.UUCP (Tom Duff)\nSummary: Overkill.\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ\n\nThe situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know\nbetter, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\ndeals with this).\n\n--",

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission.

Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Sze, Journal of Geophysical\n    Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.\n\n    Charles Jackman, Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch,\n    Code 916, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center,\n    Greenbelt, MD  20771\n\n    Also see _Chemical Rockets and the Environment_, A McDonald, R Bennett,\n    J Hinshaw, and M Barnes, Aerospace America, May 1991.\n\n\n    HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE\n\n    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a\n    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you're dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).\n\n    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.\n    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team's medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Depends on WHY it misfired....\n\n\nI can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\n\n\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\n\n\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those\n'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily\nredundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.\n\n\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\nthan magazines though.\n\n\nTrue, but this is a training function.\n\n\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)",

The latter was written with\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\n\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\n    Snyder's USGS publication \"Map Projections--A Working Manual\", USGS\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    \"An Album of Map Projections\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

    "context": "By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"",

We can get back to the \nquestion of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have \nnot adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.\n\n   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my\n   point in the post, that you \"responded to\". The point is that since Israel \n   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights \n   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic \n   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.\n\nIf a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \ntell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others \n   |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or \n   |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. \n\n   |> Such as the right to live?

Why ? because\n   any system can solve it. \n   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). \n\nI asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for \nall people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that \nmistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your \nreply.\n\n   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) \n   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:\n\t   \"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both\n\t   peoples together in this country....

And there is no other way than\n\t   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to\n\t   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be \n\t   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to\n\t   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.\"\n\t\t\t\t   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967\n\t\t\t\t   (\"Courtesy\" of Marc Afifi)\n\nJust a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to \ngetting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS\ncharter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd\nbe interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to \na _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he\nwrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have\ntheir share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will\nmake any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to \nmake a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get \nsomething back.\n\n\n   \"We\" and \"our\" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). \n\n   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the \n   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !\n\n   I think that is fair enough .\n\nNo, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve \nthe problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.\nGuess where that takes your logic?

Most Greeks insist even \ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\n\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\n\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \nby the name of 'Cons*.'\n\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\n\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \nof Anatolia.\n\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\n\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\n\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\n\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \nfacts count.\n\nAs for Selanik,\n\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\n  the great port of Izmir.\n\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

I question their integrity and fortitude. \nThere is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly.\nDifferent people are at different levels of development in different\nareas.

Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate\nquestions should I question him, only when I have developed\nmy skills enough should I challenge him.

FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I \nthink you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an \nobservation...\n\nHowever, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of\nchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for\nthe 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names\nbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.\n\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\nwhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\nplay in.

I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges).

There\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\n\n[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\nof the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\ntext.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\nit has much practical effect.\n\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\nthat don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\nall the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition\nthat's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\ninconsistencies.

Looks to me\nlike the other shoe has dropped.\n\n\tJim Gillogly\n\tTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:00\n\n-------------------\n\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\n     ---------------------------------------------------\n\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\n\n\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\n\n\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\nenforcement.\n\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n \n     ",

Send email to\n  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the\n  list. From the charter:\n\n  > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.\n  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt\n  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for\n  > privacy.

It's written in PERL, and is\n  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).\n  Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and\n  modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are\n  amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites\n  become operational. Address all points in the section\n  ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to\n  advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term\n  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.\n\n_____\n<4.8> What are references on privacy in email?\n\n\n  Brown, Bob. ``EMA Urges Users to Adopt Policy on E-mail Privacy.''  \n  Network World (Oct 29, 1990), 7.44: 2.\n  \n  Bairstow, Jeffrey. ``Who Reads your Electronic Mail?''

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\n  > jurisdictions.\n\n  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe\n  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:\n  \n  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret\n  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal\n  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a\n  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,\n  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. \n  > \n  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in\n  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,\n  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke\n  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer\n  > seizure policies.

It's rather like the \n  > `anarchy' of the English language.  Nobody rents English, and\n  > nobody  owns English.    As an English-speaking person, it's up\n  > to you to learn  how to speak English properly  and make whatever\n  > use you please  of it (though the government provides certain\n  > subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit).  \n  > Otherwise, everybody just sort of  pitches in, and somehow the\n  > thing evolves on its own, and somehow  turns out workable.  And\n  > interesting.   Fascinating, even.   Though a lot  of people earn\n  > their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  English,\n  > `English' as an institution is public property, a public good.  \n  > Much the same goes for the Internet.   Would English  be improved\n  > if  the `The English Language, Inc.'  had a board of directors\n  > and a chief  executive officer, or a President and a Congress?  \n  > There'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot\n  > fewer new ideas.  \n\n\n_____\n<7.3> Most Wanted list\n\n  Hopefully you have benefitted from this creation, compilation, and\n  condensation of information from various sources regarding privacy,\n  identity, and anonymity on the internet.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

    "context": "Howdy,\n\nI'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the\nknowledge and expertise available here.\n\nThe Subject:  After-market cruise controls\n\nThe Background:\nI recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five \nscrews, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n\t    device?\n\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n\t    worth the cabbage?\n\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n\t    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.",

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     \"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn't have \nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

Advice from a grad student.\n\n\tI agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \nlearn as much as possible about it.  \n\n\tIn my five years of education in this field, though brief \ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \n \n\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\n\n\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\nsophamore year.                  \n\n\tHey you may be so interested in this field that you \ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\n\n\tAbout the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

    "context": "Jeff,\n  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony\nCPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed\nspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video\ncapabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it\ntakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is\nabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of\ncomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half\na year and I love it.  \nSecond, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a\nSupra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons\nwhy there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only\ncomplaint was that they did not always return my calls.  \nI have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's\n(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.\n\n-David",

    "context": "Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n\"drift\" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n",

    "context": "\nTo answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,\nbut I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have\nmerely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject\nthe notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without\nadding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could\nbe \"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\"  You still have not\nanswered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.\n\n\nYou won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.\nIf you want a definition of human being that does not depend on\nthe vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,\nprovide it for me.\n\n\nMore irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law\nhas made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does\nnot follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,\nbrain death is not a means of determining who has the rights\nof the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant\ndifference.\n\nWhat I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that\nyou feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the\nthread you started?  You got answers to your questions when\nyou began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some\nridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,\nchanged the subject with your remarks about having a discussion\nof substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,\nwhy then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss\nsilly accussations, e.g. \"It really doesn't matter to you...\"\nIf it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek\nsome substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person\nof the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic\nand show some meaning to your words.\n\n\nAs others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on\nwhich has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy\nfails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.\nA woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore\nmy statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would\nnot be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?\n\n\nIs it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.\n\n\nYou simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is\nnot accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on\nfor size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill\nthe other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.\nBut the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the\nother in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The\nsystems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling\nto see anything analagous here and failing to do so.\n\n\nYour argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total\nfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in\nreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert\nthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,\nthat of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,\nyou give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one\nhand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than\na hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins\nmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each\nother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe\nin now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions\nare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where\nthey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,\nthere is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim\nthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a\nclaim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to\nits claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?\n\n\nYou haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.\n\n\nAgain you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and\nit is not as slow as you seem to think.\n\n\nYes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that\nhe was murdered by a religious, \"pro-life\" fanatic.  Please do\ntry to stay relevant.\n\n\nClever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.\n\nWhat happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?\nWhy does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her\nkidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What\nis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this\nout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one\ncase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born\nchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus\ncan), and in this case you recognize a significant difference\nbetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at\nstake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are\nirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction\nanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have\nborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a\nhealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as\nshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at\nparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and\nthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary\nthan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.",

Here are the highlights:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tR    H   E    \n             Oakland\t\t2    9   0\n\t     Detroit            3    7   1\n\nChad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the \nbottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the\nTigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to\ntie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).\n\nThe A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo\nhomer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the\n7th for the other Tiger run.\n\nJohn Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting\nthrough the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas\nin the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was\nreplaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and\nfinally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while\nWitt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.\n\nIn the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said\nits one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It\nwas a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously\nvery happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:\n\n                WOOF!      Go Tigers!",

And key size is one of the things that can be\n   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\n   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\n   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\n   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\n   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\n   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\n   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\n   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\n   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\n   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nConsider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and\nnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system\nmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now\nonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits\nwouldn't turn up anything interesting.\n\n   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\n   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\n   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but\nI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy\nwhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search\ntake far less than 2^80 encryptions.

And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have\nallowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n",

    "context": "THE DIVINE MASTERS       \n      \n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \n          \n               But there are some very important related facts that \n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \n          most other world religions. \n           \n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          \"silver cord\". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \n          Mat\" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \n          REPLACE blind faith. \n    \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n",

It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.\n \n",

The historical evidence proves that during \nthe period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, \nassisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people \nbecause of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts \nof sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, \nset up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts \nbehind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly \nattacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population \nindiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent \nMuslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with \naxes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt\nalive as can be seen below.\n\nWidespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions \nof Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and \nMaras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,\nalso had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from \nbehind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \nEastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed \nwidespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena\nwas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from \nErzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide \nby Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, \nRussian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French \njournalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century\ncommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.\n\nThe Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, \nKars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their \nvillages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.\nThe massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for\nhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,\nAustrian, French and American authorities.\n\nAlmost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and \ncruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by \nArmenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish \nand Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. \nEven today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of \nthe victims of these cruelties can be heard.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        \"Document No: 76,\" Archive No: 1/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer \n        No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53.\n        (To Lt.

Although two months\n have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I\n have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at \n almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

    "context": "\n\n\n\nHere's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

Otherwise, the key \nmanagement problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system \nunworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place\nat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in \ntheir data base?\n\nThis means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key \nalgorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is \nrather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making\nchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds\nare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that \ncould break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   \n\nAs for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to\nban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they \nneed to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key\nregistration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely\nis that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont \nhave the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they\ntalk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but\ncarefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.\nThey seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without \ncourt order even though tapping a phone line requires one.

What I mean is that our \nculture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather\nthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer \nan initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\n\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \nperspective on the \"church choosing process\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12\nthat God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all\nbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\nGod is trying to place me.\n\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\ngo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of\nGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as they\nhop from natural family to family.\n\nIf you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an \neasily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more\nlike an orphan. Prayerfully go and \"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\"\nand see if anyplace feels like home. \n\nI wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you\nhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand\nthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking\nfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand\nif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that\nwherever you go. \n\nIn general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that\ntalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is\nexpanding on that base.",

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,\nstick to the 10W40.\n\n",

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, \nthe Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated \nin the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion\nand national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself.\nDuring World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and\ncringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication\nin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]\n\n\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)\n when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it \n becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon\n method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Amarian.\n\n \"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities\n  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the \n  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian \n  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish \n  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see \n  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...\n  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise \n  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would \n  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of\n  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

    "context": "Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly's infield sneaker\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a \nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\n\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \nargued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\ntossed.\n\nThe Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\n\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\n(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\n\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\n\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\nin late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\nwork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit\nsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.\n\nThe Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory\ntoday.

We can discuss regarding baptisms\nand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.\nWe can discuss certain concepts regarding the\nendowment (\"the ritual\").\nHowever, there are certain elements I can not\ndiscuss with anyone (including other saints)\noutside of the temple.\nAs a portion of the endowment, we receive the\ntokens and signs that will permit us access\nto Heaven.

In 1985\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\nthem.\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\nsignals intelligence operation of this group.\"\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\nonly increase their numbers.\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\nand civil liberties questions involved.\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\nan investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\nconviction rate high.\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\n(even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\nvote for morality.\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\n     To most of the American public, the word \"hacker\" has\nrightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\".\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.

The times they are a changing,\nand just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\nevaluate another approach.\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\nvous concerne, cheri?\n",

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.",

When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",
