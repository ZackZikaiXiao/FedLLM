I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.",

    "context": "The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n\tSt. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\n\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\n\n\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

P. A1.\n \n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\n 12,000 people.\n \n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\n \n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\n any laws.\n \n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\n Angeles and San Francisco.\n \n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\n \n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\n is based in South Africa.\n \n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\n \n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\n the search warrant.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\n be reached for comment, his office said.\n \n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\n \n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\n conducted without a warrant.\n \n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\n record speaks for itself.\"\n \n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\n Patterson.\n \n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n under surveillance.\n \n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\n \"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\n say, 'Pinko.'\"\n \n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\n \n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\n photographs.\n \n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\n \n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\n nature of the spy operation.\n \n The file notes that Kraft's articles \"appear frequently in The Times\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\n information.\n \n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\n \n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\n \n \n \n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\n \n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\n police information on citizens and groups.\n \n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\n violations and conspiracy.\n \n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\n spectrum.\n \n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\n files on political figures.\n \n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\n deciding what charges to file.\n \n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\n years.\"\n \n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\n information illegally, he said.\n \n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\"\n \n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\n \n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\n \n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\n \n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\n \n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\n the district attorney said.",

It is an excelent way to deal \nwith the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,\nit doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But\nat this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social\nproblems? \n\n\nThere are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.\nIn many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places\nwhere almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those\nwhere guns are less common.\n\n\nThis is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government\nand that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish\nor restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some\nvague \"common good.\" ",

Why do atheists organize in groups?  \nWhat is there to discuss?\n\nResponse:\n\nMany things are discussed here, including:\n\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's\n  family\n* Prayer in schools\n* Discrimination against atheists\n* Sunday trading laws\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\n* Why people become atheists\n\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\n\nResponse:\n\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\n\nResponse:\n \nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\ndetails.\n\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not.\"\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\n\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it.\"\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n",

Since I have two floppy drives in\nmy system, I'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by Archive to \nattach my tape drive as a third floppy device.\n\nThe problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine,\nboth the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless\nI switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).  Since\nthe DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it?  Has anyone\nseen similar problems?  Any solutions?  Thanks in advance.",

The above abstract lists various\npossible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung\nproblems.

I'm going to track down that\nstudy hopefully tomarrow.\n\n[...]\n\n\nWhat justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of \nresearch?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not\nprove anything.\n\n\nHeroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration\nand shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they\neffect people differently.  \n\n\nStereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that \nfunction just fine in society.  \n\n\nName some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.\n\n[...]\n\nNO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough\ndata to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis\nis benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they\nare only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,\nand that makes them stronger.  \n\n\nthe hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as\na *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.\n\n[...]\n\nIn general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer\ncontribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,\nand I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by\nword of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has\ndecreased significantly.  \n\ngotta run to class..\n\n-marc\nandersom@spot.colorado.edu\n",

    "context": "Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\tSun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n\tprocessing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \nfile type will be automatically detected.\n\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\n\nThe hex format has been changed.\n\nNew time options have been added.\n\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\n\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\n\nNew flags:\n-R\tread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\n-ttt\tprints delta times\n-tttt\tprints times relative to the first frame\n-W\twrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\n-x\tprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \n\tSample output:\n\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\n\n-X\tprint TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\n-z\twrite TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\n-Z\twrite frames and TCP data to stdout\n\n\nMartin M.

Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don't think \"extra-scientific\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).",

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\nand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\nWhat prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\nPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\nThis is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\nstood by the Pope.\n\nIt appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\ndisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\nauthority and discipline.  \n\nMy question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n  don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\nIf not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\nIf I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\nthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\nI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nThe Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction\nviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical\nCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike \"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n\nWe sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\nEast and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n \n\nI thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\nerror in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\nI may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nWhat would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\nregarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?

SSPX does not view the\nPope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n \n\nTrue enough.\n\n\nOne could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction.\nI don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.\n \nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n-- ",

    "context": "Hi everyone,\n\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\nsoftware on these groups:\n\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\n\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\n\nFeatures:\n\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\n   Generic clients.\n   Customizable servers.\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\n        attached.\n\nFunctionality:\n\n  Client:\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n\tfaster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I've provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\n                           versions)\n        dogfight - 72 lines\n\nLocation:\n\n   This software is located at the following site:\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\n\n   Directory:\n   pub/virtual-worlds\n\n   File:\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\n\nFutures:\n\n   Client:\n\n    o Texture mapping.\n\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\n\n    o HMD support.\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Server:\n\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\n\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Both:\n\n    o Improved Comms!!!\n\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\nsoftware,\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\n\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\n\nFinally one major disclaimer:\n\nThis is totally amateur code.

I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad\nthat may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nDisclaimer over!\n\nOf course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with\nPOSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me.

    "context": "Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.",

The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\n    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n\t     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works\n    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market\n    bookstore.\n\n    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):\n\n      J.

I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com",

If\nwe say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.  \nThere is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words\nthat are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not\nadded to the canon.\n\nIs new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation\nI'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times\nis not necessary as we have that in Scripture.\n\nYou also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of\nitself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is\nclosed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept\nof canon is later historically.)\n\n\nI agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage,\nexhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is\nmeant to bring a `word' of the form \"the man you live with is not your\nhusband\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture.\nI would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery.\nThe reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.\n\nRegards\n David",

Without delving into a deep discussion of\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\n\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\n: scientific perspective, just different.\n\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\n \n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\n: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\n\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \n\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \n\nI can understand Scott's reaction:\n\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \n: \n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\n: cannot *know* that.\n\nI hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\n\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\n: >>diseases/disorders.\n\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, \nthe intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass \ngraves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed \nwhat fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.\n\nThe problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of \noppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot \nofficials and their violation of the co-founder status of \nthe Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat \nengineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution \nto the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked \nTurkiye's intervention.

There simply \nwas not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at \nall. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which \nwas openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece. \nSince the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish \npopulation, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder\nof the republic with the Greek population.\n\nThe Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded\nGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that\nstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with\na minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are\nnot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the\nonly way they could show that was to assert their \nautonomy in a separate republic.\n\nTurkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would\nrather not be involved with the island. But, given the\ndismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish\npopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate\nof the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until\nthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord\nthe two communities finally reach to guarantee that\nhistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots\nof their rights, liberties and their very lives.\n\n\n  Source: 'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island,' A.

It is surprising to note that a large majority of\npeople, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though\n90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland,\nreligious people are actually a minority. \n\nCould it be possible that many people believe in god \"just in case\"?\nIt seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's\nWager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe\nreads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,\nbut doesn't know what or how. \n\nPeople don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\nthat they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them.\nReligion is not something to think about. \n\nI'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\ndream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - \na promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.\nCoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our\nmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many\npeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow\n(and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )\n\n: Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\n: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\n: typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\n: same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\n: other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\n: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\n: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\n: expresses its own selfishness.\n\nIf logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking\nis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary\nassumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe\nin gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.\n\nHowever, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears\nsome resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics\nworks? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that\nperhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics. \n\nIs usefulness any criterion?\n\nPetri\n",

And Windows 3.1 is\nalso flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files\nonto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them\nless annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.\n\n\nNo, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to\ncorporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*\ndealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the\nregistration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to\nbe solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour\nreinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one\nway or another.\n\nSo, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the\nprocedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:\n\n1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want\nto install it.  I've been using c:\\WINSTALL myself.\n\n2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\WINORIG.\n\n3.  Install from c:\\winstall.\n\n4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  \n    i.e., comp *.* \\winorig\\*.* >\\report.txt\n\n5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\nthey didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\n\n6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't\nreally do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\nhis copy than with \"real pirates\" who will probably just disassemble\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\n\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\ndon't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff\nI've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if\nthey'd ever find out.

The other important feature\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\n\n\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\nmore knobs required of a \"real\" scope :-)\n\n\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated\nthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy\nalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\n\nOne more thing about the new, \"simpler\", front panels. These instruments\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\nover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our\nscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these\nswitches.

Are you truly the master of yourself?\n\nI have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.\nThat I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake\nunwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect\nof my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but\nthen say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.\nI, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me\nthis help.  And I took him up on his offer.

You better get rid\nof your emotions.\n\nAnd I do have a good reason to believe what I do.\n\n\n\nThe topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my\nGod says.

And that\nwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's\nwishful thinking.\n \n\nIs this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most\npeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they\nare imperfect.  Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine\nof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.

In this case I'd say the relevant\nstatistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to\ntotal casualties from among the total civilian population in the\naffected geographical area.\n\n\nVietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.\n\n\nWestern news in general, but in particular the American \"mass media\":\nCBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole\nwar was one of \"those poor, poor Iraqis\" along with \"look how precisely\nthis cruise missile blew this building to bits\".\n\n\nI agree.\n\n\nPerhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy\nto say from our \"enlightened\" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All \nthings considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were\nessential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick\nend to avoid even greater allied losses.\n\nI, for one, don't regret it.\n\n\nSure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more\nreason to depose these \"entrenched political rulers operating in their\nown selfish interests\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\nas well??\n\n\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\nstrong response from the West was required.\n\n\nWell, it's not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\n\nI mentioned it.\n\nIf we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\nhis grandiose quest for a \"Thousand Year Reich\".  The consequences\nstemmed from that.\n\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\n\n\n\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\nofficers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too.\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\n\n\nSo?  It's \"hard to imagine\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity\ngained acceptance from the revered author of \"Constructing a Logical\nArgument\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)\n\n\nI have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution\nnor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to\nthe silence of the principals.  \n\n\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that \nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\n\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\n\n\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (I'm a \nMonty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)\n\nOf course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem\ncontradictory.

Not that I doubt that YOUR applications\nare failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA\nthey're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).\nEvery new chip set confuses them.\n\n\nI think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and\nit's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to\nfix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.

Microsoft uses this gimmick,\ntoo.)\n\n\nThe SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my\nknowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the\nHercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the\nnumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing\nwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the\n8514, as if anyone cared.)

What's kind of silly is IIT's\nuse of a hardwired \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then\nsat on a tack\" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in\nreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the \"Bart\nSimpson optimization,\" in which you save the bitmap of the\nmost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a\nscreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a\nsecond time in a row.  (We call it the \"Bart Simpson optimization\"\nbecause Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he\ncould right \"I will not cheat on benchmarks\" a hundred times and be\ndone in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)\n\n\nWe don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.

    "context": "McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\n\n        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern\nCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last\nSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. \"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today's engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\nparents' time.\"\n\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. \"It's essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\n\n        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\nwe're going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\nsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let's not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\ninvestments.\"\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.",

PDT\n\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \nare the priorities, because there are several association of \nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \n\t     \n\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \nsome influence over the distribution of.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \nunpopular.  \n\t     \n\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \nour side and on the Russian side.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \n\t     \n\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \ninvestment.  \n\t     \n\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \nof the Cold War.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \nof a very measured breakthrough.  \n\t     \n\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \ninherited from the Cold War?  \n\t     \n\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \nwe agreed to continue to press that.\n\t     \n\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \nthe NPT regime is critical.\n\t     \n\t     What was the second question?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \nleadership of the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \nmuch less.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \nbegin it in the fairly near future.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \nlast part of your speech?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \nas much as I could about your history.  \n\t     \n\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \npersonal feeling about Russia.  \n\t     \n\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \noccurred.  \n\t     \n\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \ncountries become closer partners.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.",

In order to \npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\none of the following:\na) An employee of a government agency.\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\n\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n\nWhy not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to\npractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs\ntakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.\n\n\nThat's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE\nROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest\nmisconceptions people have about our hobby. \n\nTrue. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get \nhit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. ",

Stats like \"plus/minus\" make RBI look good.\n\n\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com",

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\nlittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\n\n/*\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\n * than the default visual.\n *\n * To compile:\n *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\n *\n * To run:\n *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\n *\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\n * to install.\n */\n\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n\tVisual\t*visual;\n\tint\tdepth;\n} OptionsRec;\n\nOptionsRec\tOptions;\n\nXtResource resources[] =\n{\n\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n};\n\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\n{\n\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\n\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\n};\n\n\n\nint\nmain (argc, argv)\n\tint\t\targc;\n\tchar\t\t**argv;\n{\n\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\n\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\n\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\n\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\n\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\n\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\n\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\n\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\n\tArg\t\targs[10];\n\tCardinal\tcnt;\n\tchar\t\t*name = \"test\";\n\tchar\t\t*class = \"Test\";\n\n\t/*\n\t * save the command line arguments\n\t */\n\n\txargc = argc;\n\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\n\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\n\n\t/*\n\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\n\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\n\t */\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\n\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\n\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\n\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\n\t{\n\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6.

What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.",

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments.\"\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?\"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn.\"\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\n\n  April 20, 1988\n  Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

    "context": "I am having something very unusual happen.  First \nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \nsectors a week.\n \n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \nsectors for a brief period of time.\n \n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\n \n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\n \n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \nabout every 100 files are affected.  \n \n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \nsmartdrv to help me out.\n",

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out \nto the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \nabout that yesterday afternoon.\n\t     \n\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \nboth making concessions?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that \nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to \ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to \nmake those adjustments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the subject of a VAT --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go \ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \nmade.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \nabout it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \nthere's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At the meetings that he's had with his own task \nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \npossible options would be?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been \npresented for a decision, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \noption?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're not saying he didn't know it was being \nconsidered, though, are you?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He knew that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \nThat's what I'm asking.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being \nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \ndon't even know that it's --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at \nthis stage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're \ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \nconsidered -- \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed \nit.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \nrepeated. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \nit were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out \nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is \nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \ncome out not from you people, but --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said \nhe would let us know. \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \nit's not going to be on the program.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On March 25th. \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \nClinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right \nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about his remark that if it were being \nconsidered, he'd tell us about it?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, \nand he'd let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And did he?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \nthis morning?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of \nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \nanswered the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying here that it didn't have to be \ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \nconsidering it.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \nPainfully clear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \nday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \nanswered that it was being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, The New York Times --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why do it yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \noranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures \nin a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, \nbut which turned out to be totally false.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally \nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \nsay that. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he \ndoing about it, if so?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \nmistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the \nmatter.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that the same information that goes to the \nPresident?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of \ninformation.  I think that's where the confusion was.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \nthat was made?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \nThe New York Times?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \nAnything?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on \nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both \nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \nwork, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to \nget this jobs package going.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no \nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the \ntiming like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer \nthis week than you were last week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going \nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the \nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's \ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \nhas changed?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on \nit.  We'll know when the votes are taken.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go \nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \naccept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've \nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted \nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He initiated the conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \nsay he's making --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly \nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that \nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \nand the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President \ndoesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \nit through, he will.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \nthe actual vote.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Today?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will \nhappen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward \nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \npassed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \nfirst one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you \ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how \ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  \nAnd I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \nwe've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \nPresident and Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \nto talk to Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation \nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they \ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \nabout the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the \nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \npackage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \nKohl or Feingold?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, is the President considering the more \npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \nquestion, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \nnot true.  It's actually waste water money.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for \nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \nbecause it's waste water money, right?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \noverall. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But the implication from your statement the other \nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \nWould you agree that's not the case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I \nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \non a VAT?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just \ndon't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So sometime since March 25th?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know \nthe exact date.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, \nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already \nproposed?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to \nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is \nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \nThe President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't \nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the \nincome tax, for instance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \nthat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \nSenator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \nhave a chance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \nforward?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \nif the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \nconsideration.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \nthat has to be considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \nThat's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that true?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the \ndeliberations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But, George --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that the only thing that's changed since his \nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But this is the President's knowledge that these \ngroups had come forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \npublished positions in the newspapers.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's \npresentations to them?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him \n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \ngroups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \nthat he had enunciated previously?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had \nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \nhealth care.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding \npositions?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \nObviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the \nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're \ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \nchange in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February \nand now --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't \nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \ntable.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's \nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you're also \ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  \nIf these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been \nmade to the President --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the \npresentations to the health care task force.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's no relationship at all between the fact \nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested \nthat they would produce all the revenue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \nappropriate ways to finance health care.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that \nhe said anything to refute that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \nthere wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \nof core benefits --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task \nforce ever suggested that there would.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \nprograms?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical \nsituation.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \non the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the \nimplications then.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \nforce has prompted this consideration?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just \ndon't have that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \noptions are?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not \ngoing to comment --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the scope --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on \nthem, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you \ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task \nforce is looking at.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the \nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does no mean yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes and no.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the \nPrime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question \nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \nvery clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your \ncharacterization of the Prime Minister's comments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \nnumerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad \ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into \nthose specifics until after the meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \nMiyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \nmore, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to \nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to \npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \nwe're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \npackages.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work \nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on \nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It's a rather emotional response.\"  \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \nHouse condone that kind of remark?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \nChristopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find \nanswers for. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \nspecific term?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with \nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \nair strikes, anything that can be done?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \npressure at this time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \nthe presidency?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard \nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard \nfor increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the \narms embargo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \nchange your thinking?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to \nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \nand talking about the arms embargo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's exactly what she said.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But \nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't \nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \nall, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be \nreleased?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  \nAnd it will be probably later today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal \nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's something that the President promised during \nthe campaign that he would do.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't \nthink it's anything that's on his plate right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  \nI assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \ndifferent groups and communities.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if that's scheduled --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's a good thing you asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I \ndon't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but \nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not \nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \nthat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific \ntiming of something like that, but it's certainly something under \ndiscussion and something we've been working on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Campaign finance reform?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think it will be next week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working \non?  I missed the question.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  \nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know \nanything about that but it's something we've certainly been working \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \nof town on the day of the march?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate \nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a \nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \non Sunday, as he did last year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \non the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the gays.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \nPresident's schedule for the day, certainly.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is \nthat Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one \nday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how \nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't \nknow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting \n-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you \nabout it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in \nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's \nnot, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \nsure --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do \nanything like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Certainly not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What marching orders did the President give to \nGeneral Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's \nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look \ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \nmilitary archives.  \n\t     \n\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \nat this stage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's \nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \nVietnamese.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final \ndetermination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we \nhave it, we'll make a judgment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know you don't have any final determination, but \ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \nthat's a likely possibility?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize \nit in any way until the review is complete.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \nin Boston?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  \nYes, I expect, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He was in on the meeting?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \nand the answer is yes. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \nreport this morning the President's distressed about some of his \npress clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \npoint out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many questions?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \noccasions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many were while he was jogging?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very \ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \nHe's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --\nEast Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval \nOffice, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the \nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local \ntelevision anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The \nPortland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \nHe's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \nConnecticut --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \narticle implies that he doesn't --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \nfor it.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment \nabout this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \ndispleasure publicly?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \ndiscussions between the President and myself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \nWebber?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \nplayer?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That is an authentic letter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a \nproposal he hasn't made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The military issue?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \nprepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had \ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \nTrade Representative and others.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     report yet?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report \nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \ntoday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He was?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the \nreport's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \nthat there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \nfeels that way?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \nhistory.\n\n\t     Q\t  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END                    1:34 P.M. EDT",

It is very unlikely, however,\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n\nNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science\nCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.\n\n   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space\nMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell\nInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\n\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\npotential to power the globe.\n\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\n\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\n\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\n\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.",

    "context": "Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...",

    "context": ":\n (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the\n  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\n\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring \n1993 edition):\n\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\n  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn't draw\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\n  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\n  that the central pillar of Christ's \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\n\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\n\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\n\n\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\nto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\narms.  \n\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \nvoice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \nthe LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \n",

    "context": "I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal \nassault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration \nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \n`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \nshould rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious \nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\n\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\n\n\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\nBut if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\n\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \nimpracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.\n\n\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \nand protecting Americans.\n\n\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\nto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\npolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\n\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \ndisarmed of it. \n\n\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\nto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of \nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will\ntrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.\n\n\nIf the administration did say this, it would find itself \nimpeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,\nestablished, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy \nguarantees. The administration would have no legal standing \nwhatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and\ncriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast \nsegments of the population.\n\n\nThe U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically \ncommitted to preserving their privacy in the face of an \nincreasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  \nTake your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.\nWe can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, \nand we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit \npattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop \nus, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.\n\n[privacy vs. law enforcement]\n\nThis is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of\nprivacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally \nincompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise. \nAmericans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, \nto preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly \nbeen eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and \n*unrepresentative* government.\n\n--",

    "context": "\nWhy don't you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionary\ncite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?\n\n\n\nAmong others, see Olney's  \"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of\nAnimal Studies to Human Safety\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol.\nvol 6: 455-462.\n\nI'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.\n\n\nWhose talking about \"food science\"? What is this comment supposed to\nmean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*,\n*Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)\n\n\nThen you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to\n\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point\nus to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.\n\n\nThey're unable to metabolise it.\n\n\nWho said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n\nOlney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches? I don't know.\n",

    "context": "I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.",

SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically \ncalls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian \nand criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government \nas merely a step on the road to said genocide. \n\nNow where shall I begin?\n\n#From: ahmet@eecg.toronto.edu (Parlakbilek Ahmet)\n#Subject: YALANCI, LIAR : DAVIDIAN\n#Keywords: Davidian, the biggest liar\n#Message-ID: <1991Jan10.122057.11613@jarvis.csri.toronto.edu>\n\nFollowing is the article that Davidian claims that Hasan Mutlu is a liar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[some parts are deleted]\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t- - -\n\n\n\n\nReceiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,\"Genocide...\" and\nwhat I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book\nwas like \"voice of Armenian revolutionists\" and although I read the whole book,\nI could not find the original quota.\nBut there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found \nthe original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:\n\n\n\n     ======================================================================\n    ======\n\nQUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !\n\nDAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU\nJUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.\n\nDavidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...\n\nYou are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow\nyou can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided\nnot to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise\nall the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least\nwe may save time by not dealing with your lies.\n\nAnd for the following line:\n\nI also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you.\nI hope you will be drowned in your lies.\n\nAhmet PARLAKBILEK\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \"it is\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?

    "context": "The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,\na 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

Chelvadae is\nmore experienced than Potvin.\n\nFinal - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.\nBelfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.\n\nConference Final - Hawks in 6.

    "context": "From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46\n\n\tThe Problem Book of Anania of Shirak\n\t------------------------------------\n\n\t\t\"On the ancient peak of Ararat\n\t\tThe centuries have come like seconds\n\t\tAnd passed on.\"\n\t\t\t\t-Avetik Issahakian\n\nby Yuri Danilov\n\nSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \"What\nbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\" And \nthough the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, \ndepending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, \nand celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, \nnot one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at\nleast one book of arithmetic problems.\n\nSome of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they \nwere trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \"numbers\" (though \nsecretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \nmathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't \nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \nno exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is \nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \nteachers.\"\n\nNow, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\nVenus and back.\n\n\t\t\tOne for the \"road\"\n\n\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \n\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with \n\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \n\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\n\n\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History \n\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \n\tthe Royal Astronomer.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\n\nThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\n\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\n\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \nproblem book.\n\n\t\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\n\n\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \n\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \n\tit the mother of all wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Anania of Shirak\n\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \nMovses of Khoren).\n\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\n\n\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\n\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \n\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \n\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\n\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \n\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \n\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \n\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \n\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\n\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\n\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\n\n\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \n\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \n\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \n\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \n\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \n\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \n\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\n\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \n\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \n\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\n\n\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \n\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \n\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \n\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \n\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \n\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \n\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\n\tat the king's court began to envy me.\n\n\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \n\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \n\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \n\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \n\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \n\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\n\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \n\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \n\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \n\toriginally.\n\n\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \n\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \n\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \n\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \n\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \n\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \n\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \n\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \n\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \n\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \n\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \n\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \n\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \n\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\n\n\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \n\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \n\tassume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \n\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\n\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \n\twith him.\n\n\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \n\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \n\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's \n\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \n\tfor my efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\tProblems and Solutions\n\n\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\n\ton verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \n\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \n\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \n\tcopies were printed in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\n\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\nmanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to \nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\" Biding\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\n\nIn the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\n\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \nfull glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.\n\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \n572.\n\nProblem 1\n\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\n\nProblem 8\n\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\n\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \naccording to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \nAnania's Problems and Solutions.\n\nProblem 18\n\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\n\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \nAnania's time -- for instance, problem 7.\n\nProblem 7\n\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\n\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself\nand offer you just one more.\n\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\n\nProblem 20\n\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\n\n\t\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\n\n\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \n\tbibliography.\n\t\t\t\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\n\t\t\t\t\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\n\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \nof Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\n\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\n\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \nprinter's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\nof Russian academic typography.\n\n\t\t\tBack to Earth\n\n\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \n\tworks in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty \n\tof this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, \n\twill work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.\n\n\t\t\t--V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to the\n\t\t\tRussian translation of Solid-Body\n\t\t\tSymmetry by R. Knox and A. Gold\n\nLet's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high \nschoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman \ncrater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take \nthis very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read \nthis article and say to himself: \"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty \ninteresting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.\"\n\nGood luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then\nthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And \nwe can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by \nIosef Orbeli.\n\n[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian.

The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her.

    "context": "I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS\n    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday\n    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate\n    points.\n\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\n\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\n    in Iran after revolution.\n\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\n\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\n    dead left from the war.\n\n    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \n    research.\"!\n\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\n\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\n    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\n\n    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\n    Iran's different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA's\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear\n    activities before\" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build\n    nuclear weapons!\n\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\n    from the absolute knowledge!\n\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\n\n\nMohammad\n",

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\n\nI don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\nIts the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\ngovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\n\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\ngunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\nto cover up.\n\n\n",

Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.",

It fails for several reasons :\n\n1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion. \n2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language\nand not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from\none country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality\nof censorship.\n\n\n\n\nYou are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance\nin which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.\nIf you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you\nthought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using\nwas a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of\ncircumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they\ndo not apply, thus the action is not permisable.\n\nObviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it\nwould be contrary to the internet comercial use.\n\n\nNow you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was\nthe fact of association between the company and the post that was important.\nThe typeface etc is inconsequential.\n\n\n\nIf you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick\nStaffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that \nadvocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it\ndirectly. \n\nCertainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to\ncall for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part\nof what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.\n\n\n\nThat is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility\ncost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is\nquite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and\nregulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example\nif a Microsoft employee were to post \"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\"\nfrom a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to\nsack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has \npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\nmanner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political\nplatform for his views.\n\n\n\nah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.\n\n\n\nYour article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature\nand pretty well damn all else. \n\n\n\nAre you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments\non the substantive case?\n\nThe initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable\njudgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be\nharmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the\nsubstance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets\nact could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.\nThe part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.\n\nHere again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that\ninformation is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated\nto third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this\ncase as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. \n\nThe crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.\nThe censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's\nludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book. \n\n\n\nFunny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in\nrejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion\nis unprovable I left it at that. \n\nSo far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your\nown. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the\nvalidity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. \nPlus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this\nproblem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret\nsession and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the\nissues are half as simple as you imply.\n\n\nI don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that\nof proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat.\n",

Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP CONTENTS\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\n\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\nvalues:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\n\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the\nsession key:\n\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMykotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\n  \nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\nkey parts.  \n\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\ninformation is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies. \n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\n\n\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\n\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\nand \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\ntesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\ndelivery in June or July.\n",

On April 23 of every year, the people \nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \nprosperously.\n\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\n\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \nGenocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \nof the Turkish Genocide.\n\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\n\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\n\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\n\n\nSerdar Argic",

    "context": "\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n\t the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n\t don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\n   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\n   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it's pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\n   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.",

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\n: come down in price.\n\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\n\nA (partial?) list:\n\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n\tconcurrently.\n\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\nadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\nhave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\nall on the same card.  \n\nSimply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.\n\nGreg.",

It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\n\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\nprior to the invasion. \n\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\n\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\n\n   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\n\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\nthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\nit and prevent further attacks.\n\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\n   would have resulted in.  \n\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\n\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\n\nNo, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\n\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\n",

    "context": "Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable 'frame'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian's questions:\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon\nsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don't THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor",

The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================",

Islamic Fundamentalists just have a\n\"better\" excuse (Qu'ran).\n \n    from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990\n    by John Davidson, Canadian Press\n \n    MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old\n    daughter that shocks the most.\n \n    \"I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what\n    happened to your parents,\" wrote Patrick Prevost. \"I loved\n    your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.\"\n \n    Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his\n    apartment in northeast Montreal.\n \n    They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after\n    killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.\n \n    The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had\n    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money\n    for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked\n    his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.\n \n    She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or\n    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.\n \n    Five children have also been slain as a result of the same\n    domestic \"battles.\"\n \n    Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their\n    husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across\n    Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for\n    Justice.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\n\n\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\n\n\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\n\t\tsend fixes #\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\n\n\tHere are a few complications:\n\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \n\"5d\" separately\n\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\n\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\n\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\n\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\n\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \npreviously was optional\n\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\n\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\n\n\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \nday's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out \nshortest-first.\n\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If \nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\nor\n        path bar!foo!frotz\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\n\n\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\n\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  60)!

Where can I get an X-based paint/draw program?\n\n\txpic is an object-oriented drawing program. It supports multiple font \nstyles and sizes and variable line widths; there are no rotations or zooms.\nxpic is quite suitable as an interactive front-end to pic, though the \nxpic-format produced can be converted into PostScript. (The latest version is \non the R4 contrib tape in clients/xpic.)\n\n\txfig (by Brian V. Smith (bvsmith@lbl.gov)) is an object-oriented \ndrawing program supporting compound objects.  The xfig format can be converted \nto PostScript or other formats. Recent versions are on the R5 contrib tape or \non export in /contrib/R5fixes (version 2.1.6 [11/92]).\n\n        idraw supports numerous fonts and various line styles and arbitrary \nrotations. It supports zoom and scroll and color draws and fills. The file \nformat is a PostScript dialect. It can import TIFF files. Distributed as a part\nof the InterViews C++ toolkit (current release 3.1, from \ninterviews.stanford.edu) .\n\n\tA version of Robert Forsman's (thoth@lightning.cis.ufl.edu) xscribble,\nan 8-bit paint program for X, is now on ftp.cis.ufl.edu in pub/thoth/. [2/93]\n\n\txpaint is available from ftp.ee.lbl.gov as xpaint.tar.Z.\n\tA rewrite, Xpaint 2.0, by David Koblas (koblas@netcom.com) was released\n2/93 as xpaint2pl3.tar.Z. xpaint is a bitmap/pixmap editing tool.\n\n\tA new OpenWindows PostScript-based graphical editor named 'ice' is now \n[2/91] available for anonymous ftp from Internet host lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu \n(129.236.10.30).  ice (Image Composition Environment) is an imaging tool that\nallows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of PostScript \nannotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging routines and NeWS PostScript \nrasterizing. (It may require OpenWindows and Sun C++ 2.0.)\n\n\ttgif by William Cheng (william@oahu.cs.ucla.edu) is available from most\nuucp sites and also from export and from cs.ucla.edu. It is frequently updated;\nversion 2.12-patch18 was released 3/93.\n\n\tThe \"pixmap\" program (info: colas@sa.inria.fr) for creating pixmaps is \non the R5 contrib tape; it resembles the bitmap client. Version 2.1 is now \navailable. [11/92]\n\n\tAlthough MetaCard is not generally classified as a paint program, a \nfull 24-bit color image editor is built into the program, which can be used for\nlight image editing and for producing color icons (info@metacard.com). MetaCard\nis available via anonymous FTP from ftp.metacard.com, csn.org, or \n128.138.213.21.\n\t\n\tpixt by J. Michael Flanery produces XPM output.\n\nAlso:\n\n\tdxpaint is a bitmap-oriented drawing program most like MacPaint; it's \ngood for use by artists but commonly held to be bad for drawing figures or \ndrafting. dxpaint is part of DEC's Ultrix release.\n\n\tFrameMaker has some draw capabilities. [4/90]\n\n\tBBN/Slate from BBN Software Products includes a full-featured draw and\npaint program with object grouping and multiple patterns; multiple X platforms.\n(617-873-5000 or slate-offer@bbn.com).

This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in\n   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.\n\n   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\n   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\n   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\n   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\n\n   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.\n\n   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true\n   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the\n   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.\n\n\n   Ahmed.\n\nForget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that\nthe PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly\nobvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for\nthe destruction of the \"Zionist entity\". As far as I know the\nIsrael-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies\nthe purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can\npost the relevant caluses.\n\nNow the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been\nposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am\nsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than\nhappy to repost it.\n\nRegardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and\neven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very\nheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.\n\nIt just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support\npeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing\none to many Jews.",

I'm a little more sore today than after working on a\n1911A1 ...\n\nA 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt\nnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

    "context": "In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the\nscope of revisionism and principally have considered the political\nimplications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n",

His explaination was that \nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \n\n\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \ncouple to be as one.\n\n\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\nanulments a half-hour later!!\n\n\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a\ncommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.\n\n\tBut I'm digressing....\n\n\t\t\tGod be with you,",

He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.",

    "context": "I'm a biker and a dog-lover.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.",

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk.

In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

If you want correct RMS for (most)\nany waveform, you need a \"True-RMS\" DVM/DMM which literally does the\nRoot-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.\n\n: \n:    Related question (less important to me):\n:    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with \n: analog ones? \n\nThe last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to\n\"see\" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking\nelectrolytic capacitors).\n\nAnymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.\n\n: \n:    Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at\n: avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. I would appreciate either \n: way.\n: \n: \n: Alexander V.

The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of\n\tthis post.\n\n\t1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:\n\n\t    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \"yes\" after its name.\n\t    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \"no\" after its name.\n\t    To abstain, leave a blank after its name.\n\n\t2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and\n\t    your first name (i.e. your personal name).\n\n\t3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the\n\t    ballot.\n\n\t4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm\n\t    (Central Time), April 24, 1993.\n\n\nBallot:\n\n----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----\n\n        (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:\n        (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:\n        (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:\n        (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n        (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:\n\n        (f)       voter's last, first name:\n\n        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24\n\n----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------\n\n\nExample Ballot #1:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John\n\n\tIn this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tto be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of\n\tcomp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view\n\ton the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. \n\n\nExample Ballot #2:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane\n\n\tIn this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all\n\tthe proposals.\n\n\nVoting Rules:\n\n\t* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          ",

    "context": "\nStop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920's.\n\n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know \nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from \ntheir footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods\nare responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject\nboundaries...",

There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.

About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.

If you just look at attacks\non villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you\ncount the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally\nthink that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires\norganisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.\nPerhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was\nso. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone\norganisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause\nfor criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the\n'Zionist' camp.\n\n\nNow you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start\nwith the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.\nAnd the previous posters were wrong, no?\n\n\nAgain I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think\nwar requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command\nand plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you\nsure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds\nlike war to me. Stone throwing does not.\n\nJoseph Askew\n",

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.",

    "context": "Hi,\n\nI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few \nconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \n\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \n\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \ndon't find any foods satisfying.\n\nThanks ",

    "context": "In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\nthat they are infallible.\n\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\nprobably agree.\n\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\nis no way out of the loop.\"\n\n\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\nleads to relativism.\n\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\n\n\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\n\n *\n\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\npoint at hand:\n\n\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\n\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\nin very limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\n\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\nget into trouble.\n\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\ncannot be certain.\n\n\n\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\n\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nto cover them up.\n\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\n\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\n\n *\n\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\n",

Go ahead and give me the details\nof the \"logic\" that led you to conclude, incorrectly, that I would\ncondone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context.  Your conclusion was\nwrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were\nguity of taking verses out of context.

Did you think that it would\nbe hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?\nDid you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of\nevidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp of\ninductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figure\nout what your mistake was, and learn from it.",

    "context": "Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20\nresponses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it\npossible.\n\nOn my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase\nand Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application\nthat can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL\nstring and receive the results.\n\nMost people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other \nproducts mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,\nRBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.\n\nFor myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C\nportability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the\nsource code, and portability is important in my application. It works\nwith DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.\n\nHowever, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.\nIt's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and\nformatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,\nexcept it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:\nthe \"ODBC Programmer's Reference\" and the \"ODBC SDK Guide\". Moreover,\nODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's \nup to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,\nit's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). \nNevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should\nmake life interesting in the future.\n\nHere's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by \na line of asterisks (*).\n\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nBorland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want. \nThe current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox\n4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was\ncompatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad\nlibrary of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think\nturbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).\n\nNow.. reading the box... it's \"Borland Paradox Engine & Database\nFrameworks\".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later,\nTurbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or\nlater.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0. It\ndoes have support for object useage...\n\nI haven't had a real chance to really use it myself... but it looks fairly\ncomplete... I'm planning to use it this summer.\n-Rick\n-- \n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nBorland has a product which is called Paradox Engine. \nI do not know about MS.\n\nThe paradox engine I know very well, and it definitiely\nnot a replacement for SQL, but it will enable you to\nsave and restore records, has locking, et al.

    "context": "I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.\n\nIn retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.\nHaldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_\n\nTHERAPY INEFFECTIVE\n\nRecently the founders of yet another prominent \"ex-gay\" ministry, Exodus\nInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.\nMichael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers\nfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.",

Dr. Branscomb\nwas the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately\nfor all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question\nmuch better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain\nacceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary\ncomplexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would \nauthority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 \nyears.\n\nWe have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented\nand proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and\nvetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by\nany of these.\n\nEven now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust\nthe DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the\npublic scrutiny.\n\n(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to \ngain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis\nof authority alone.)\n\nWe had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \"break\" the\nDES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they\ncan \"break\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in\nwhat time.\n\nThe fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important\nas what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the\ncost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.\nAt this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of\nany successor to overcome this knowledge gap.\n\nDES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century\nand the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.\nWe are damned lucky to have them.",

    "context": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nDear Josh\n\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\n\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\n\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\n\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\nYou did not respond to my question.\n\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\n\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\nimprisoned.\n\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\n\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\nhis homeland ?\n\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\n\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\nArabs ?\n\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\n\n\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\ncomments.",

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \n \n \n \nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\nand politeness.  You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord's \nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\n \nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\nexample, God's code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\nto us are also applicable to God.\n \nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \"morality\"\ncan be sensibly applied.",

    "context": "ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!\n\n  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, \nether sucking structures, AND why we observe \"orbital\" motion!!\n\n  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic \nwaves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the \nMichelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. \n\n  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact \nthat the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the \nearth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as \"earth's\" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of. ",

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was\nwritten and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen\n<mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of\nnewsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM\nis redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\n----------\nI am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It\ndoes not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but\nit has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and\nsome other stuff.  The URL is \"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\".\n\nThis month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information\non patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to\nhave a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again\nsoon. :-)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice,\ntalk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law,\nexport regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.\n\nLIST OF QUESTIONS\n-----------------\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n5)  What is RSA?\n6)  What is DES?\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n8)  What is PEM?\n9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n13)  What is PGP?\n14)  What about RPEM?\n15)  What is MIME?\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy\n Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\n four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\n (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\n non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\n Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\n Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\n (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\n shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\n weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\n change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\n README file that this law not be violated:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\n residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\n file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\n product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\n distribute it.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\n originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\n origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\n (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\n sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\n authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm\n that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\n in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\n also may be in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\n standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\n near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\n stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\n interoperability.\n\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\n RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\n parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\n channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\n a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\n function will be used if this is accepted as true.\n\n8)  What is PEM?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\n working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\n key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\n is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\n\n10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n\n This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\n the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\n 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\n met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\n addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\n cryptography.\n\n This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\n everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\n patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\n cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\n (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\n and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\n compressed with a patented algorithm.)\n\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n\n RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\n specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\n firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\n patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\n\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\n      (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\n\n      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\n\n      Cryptographic Communications System and\n      Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829\n\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\n\n PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\n cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\n example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\n PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\n companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\n products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\n patents.\n\n RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\n its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\n author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\n However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\n interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\n people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\n code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\n award.\n\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\n Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\n key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\n those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys\n are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\n generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\n\n13)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\n   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\n   compatible with anything other than itself.\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\n   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\n   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\n   patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\n   either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\n   (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\n   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\n   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\n   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\n   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.\n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\n   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,\n which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\n liability concerns.\n\n14)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\n written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\n to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\n accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n15)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\n MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\n of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\n messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\n Internet documents exist on the matter.\n\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\n\n Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\n Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\n rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\n rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know\n much more than that.\n\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...",

The tool survived\n the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot\n altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.\n\n    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,\n\n    \"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've\n lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\"\n\n    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a\n Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on\n April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the\n report and Discovery was launched with its \"extra payload\".  NASA\n officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th\n launch date.\n\n    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB\n technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,\n its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a\n part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.\n\n    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that\n the Shuttle processor will take \"appropriate action\".  Thiokol is a\n subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nKarl Anderson\t\nDEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control\n\nDept 53K/006-2\t\tRochester, Minnesota 55901\n253-8044\t\tTie 8-453-8044\nINTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com\nPRODIGY: CMMG96A",

Come on,\nJoe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\nWhy they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\nof comparing two goaltenders.\n\n\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\n\n\nDon't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\nDom has played well too.\n\n\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\nKasper...\n\n\nMostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain\nautographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen\nguards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they\ngot their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.",

In fact,\na warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before\nthe attack was to begin.\n\nBy all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing\nwas unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.\nThus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not\nattacked with intentions of killing any civilians.\n\nTo even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the\nHolocaust is absurd.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n* What is an attack?\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\n\n* What is an attack?\n\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\n\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\n\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\n\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\n\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\n  n = 2, and so on.\n\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\n  is strong!''\n\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\n\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\n\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\n  \n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\n  or) of K and P.\n\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\n\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\n\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\n\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\n  a nontrivial attack.\n\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\n  other decryption P_2.\n\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\n  decrypt further messages.\n\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\n\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\n\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\n\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\n\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\n  possible keys.\n\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.",

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

For those interested in joining, please send e-mail\nto that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.\n\nThe blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original \nannouncement for where Motif++ can be obtained.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n8< - 8< -\n\n\nWelcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!\n\nThe Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++\nwrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++, \nswap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the \nbindings. \n\nAll requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.\nshould be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl\n\nAll e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so\nplease make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to\nmessages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded \nfrom auto-replies.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.\n\n8< - 8< -\n\nHello Motif World,\n\nover the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to\nthe Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n",

In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\n    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\n\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\n    for further details.\n\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\n    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.\n\n    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning\n    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to\n    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.\n\n    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in\n    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.\n\n    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;\n    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid\n    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to\n    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and\n    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from\n    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,\n    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.\n\n    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and\n    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your\n    name\". Email saying \"INDEX SEDS-L\" to list the archive contents.\n\n    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status\n    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in\n    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\" to join.\n    Email saying \"INDEX SEDSNEWS\" to list the archive contents.\n\n    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which\n    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him\n    to join the list.\n\n    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a\n    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate\n    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list\n    address rather than the request address.\n\nPERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION\n\n    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is\n    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group\n    sci.space.news created for this purpose).

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if\nthey wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion\nwhere they were both part of the same \"mandate territory\" - read\ncolony.\n\nIsrael has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another\ncountry because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost\nall wars of aggression have started.\n\n\n\nAgain territorial expansion by force.\n\n\n\nThe UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every\nnation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).\n\n\n\nSo the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and \na continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation\nbecause the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the\nIsraeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.\n\n\n\nThey were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return\nof the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the\nPrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud\nbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous\npopulation.\n\nThe pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the \nredefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\nmust not be changed. \n\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\n\n\n\nTheyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that\nwould last no more than hours against tanks,\n\n\nDon't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the\nnegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf\nthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.\n\nIf the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have\ncut the money supply.\n\n\nNot at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.\n\n\nThe existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country\nto annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.\n\n\nUnless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.\nAraffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.\n\n\nThe real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the\nPalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it\nis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the\nreturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the\ndismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against\nnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. \n\nThe irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has\na non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the\nIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean\noutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying\nor using much of the land. \n\n",

He's on the Winnipeg Jets' injury list, as he has been since\n: his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators.  He's out until\n: next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.\n\n: Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks, but he's now the third\n: line center with the Jets, and has been since mid January or so.\n\nSorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back\ndown in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guess\nthis says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of\ntheir top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.",

    "context": "I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The\ndesign was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat\nofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit\ndifficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The\nsecondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint\nof practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid\nexceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.\nThe microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect\nat a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading\nby bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an\nautomobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in\noperation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your\n1993 RX-7!\n\nThe ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions\nunder which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and\nvelocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to\ncollect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the\ndrivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer\ncurrently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading\nout use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion\nof your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your\ndriving style, it could also provide valuable information from\nactual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.\nI personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving\ndemographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.\n\n",

My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.

Why do *you* want to?\n\n\nIf your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --\nprovide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind\nfaith that could be applied equally well to any religion.\n\n\nThat's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.\nShall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?\n\n\nYou've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting\nBible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that\nwill level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if\nyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,\nyou've got some convincing to do.\n\n\nAnd in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities\nwhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding\nand enjoyment of your life.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n\t    st1144a\tst138a\t    st274a\tst3283a\nst1057a     st1156a\tst1400a     st280a\tst351ax\nst1090a     st1162a\tst1401a     st3051a\tst9051a\nst1102a     st1186a\tst1480a     st3096a\tst9077a\nst1111a     st1201a\tst157a\t    st3120a\tst9096a\nst1126a     st1239a\tst2274a     st3144a\tst9144a\nst1133a     st125a\tst2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************\tT E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist\nwho has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following\nare reasonable conclusions:\n\n1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.\n2. The cause it not understood.\n3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.\n4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but\nthere have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with\nany of these experimental drugs.\n5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.\n6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes\nabates or goes away after a few months.\n7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.\n8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.\n9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on\nsomething else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.\n10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.\n11.

When I held down shift during startup to disable\nall extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using\nthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.\nThe shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked\nthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell\nme if it works.\n\nI am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for\ninspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they\nhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the\ninspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the\nkeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info\nfrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them\nthe keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service\nlines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.\n\n-David",

    "context": "Archive-name: rec-autos/part4\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate\ncrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]\n\n[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,\n    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]\n\n                Commonly Asked Questions\n\nRadar Questions:\n\nQ:  Where are radar detectors illegal?\n\nA:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit\n    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\n\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,\n              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation\n\n    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,\n              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company\n\n    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,\n              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin\n\n    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,\n              or Bavarian Motor Works\n\n    MG:     Morris Garage\n\n\nQ:  Does VW own Porsche?\n\nA:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and\n    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.",

    "context": "\n       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\nabusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid\nto worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused\nin thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\n\n\n       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\npork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  \n\n       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\ntotal government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.\n\n\n       This is very likely.\n\n\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\nhalf the per-car death rate.\n\n\n      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\n\n\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\n\n       You may take that for what it's worth.\n",

[Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!",

Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be\ncut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.\n\nAs St. Augustine said, \"I did not invent original sin, which the\nCatholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a\ndoubt are a follower of a new heresy.\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)",

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\npolice agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n        decipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \nknows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\n\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \"retired\" from intelligence\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\n\nDon't think it'll happen?  \n\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\norganization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\nas well.)\n\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will \nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \nwill be a moral dilemma.\n\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer.

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n",

They designed the system to make it\ndifficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the\nfourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the\ngovernment to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John\nHancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.\n\nThink about it.

Within hours,\neveryone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being\nmonitored more closely than ever before possible.\n\nWithout the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools\nlike this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be\nsuccessfully imposed.\n\nWhy give the government tools with which to enslave you?

Coups have happened in\ncountries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.\nGovernments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted\nfor more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by\ndictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never\never ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and\nthe lives of your children and other loved ones on it?\n\nIf we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we\nmake it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because\nif it happened with the tools already in place it could actually\nstick. \n\nNaive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where\nhundreds that have gone before have failed.

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n\tmany key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought\nI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand. \n \n-- \nboundary",

If we are going to get anywhere in \nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never \naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\n \n\t[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms \n\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \n\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\n\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \n\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \n\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n\tlike civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\n\tthat will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n\tBut if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves\n\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \n\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n\nThis is just another \"selectively applied\" statement.\n \nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?\nSince they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\n\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\n\n\nWhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\n\n\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\nwere commonplace.\n\n\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\nis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\nmirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\n\nThat's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \"take over\"\nLebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\nWhat both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". The Arabs/\nPalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\nsituation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\ncompensate for the increased risks",

    "context": "Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n\tI'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we \"graded\" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat's because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to\nsee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.",
