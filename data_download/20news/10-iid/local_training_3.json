I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n(1.5).\n\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \n\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!

Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign\ncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians\nare concerned and as far as common sense has it. \n\nIt is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens\nand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists\nwill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same\nrights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.\n\nSomebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel\nis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be\nentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel\nto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master\nand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.\n\nTo close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence\nand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a\ncrime.

It just reflects the abyss \nto which Israeli society has degraded. \n\nI would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain\nwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return\nand live there ?

    "context": "DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]\n\n\n          Born 1972\n          Attended 9th Grade\n          Middle School No. 17\n\n          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25\n          Microdistrict No. 3\n          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\nReally, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came \nhome from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \ncousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \nthat I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\n\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \ntaken for Armenians.\n\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \nbuilding where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was \npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking\npassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\n\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call \nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, \nthat's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very \nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \nthere weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\nAvakian was killed, too.\n\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We \nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\ndecided she had already left.\n\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\n\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \ncould do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He \nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \nhad knives and steel truncheons.\n\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if\nI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\npush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\n\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \nstrike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \nlose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \ntheir balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is \nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\n\nWe were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, \nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a \nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \naway, and everything will be OK.\n\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \no'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are \nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\n\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\nbefore the 27th.\n\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \nthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.\n\nMy father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\n\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\n\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \ncalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of \nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \nyears old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\n\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from \nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\n\n\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\n\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\n\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\n\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\n\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \nArmenia.\n\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\ncan do that.\n\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\n\nYou can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \nin the hands of our government.\n\nJune 13,1988\n\nStepanakert \n",

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\n\n\t2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't\n\"saved\".\n\n\t3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\nhas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big\ngeneralizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \nI've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\ncharismatic.",

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

WHY?\n\nI believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,\nand it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part\nin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, \nas it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof\nmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests\nfor sufficient fire power. \n\nImportant dates: \nFeb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.\nFeb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.\t   \n\nOn Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon\nban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\nin N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\nan Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\nagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some\ngroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially\nat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \non \"Street Stories\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \"get \nready fast\", as \"they know we are coming\". I believe this attack continued, \neven tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \ndown. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to\ncome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.",

It is my opinion that most educated\nor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.\nThis should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time\nwill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was \ncreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.\nThat and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press\nportrays a group of people as \"nuts\" or crazies, a violation of those\npeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

    "context": "The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\nKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...",

    "context": "To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\n\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!",

They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left). Nurses struggle in primitive\nconditions  (centre)  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift\noperating  theatre set  up  in a  train carriage.  Grief-stricken\nrelatives in  the town of Agdam  (right) weep over the  coffin of\nanother of the massacre victims. Calculating the final death toll\nhas been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24\nhours.\n\nPhotographs: Liu Heung / AP\n             Frederique Lengaigne / Reuter\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nSerdar Argic",

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object\nis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\neven though it is not detectable.\n\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\nmisunderstood?\n\n\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\". I think I need some\nmore time with this one.\n\nThat's about it for now!\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:",

    "context": "/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /\n\n\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\n\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\n(within a minute or so) death.\n\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\n\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\nthe attacker.\n\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\nknife attacks in prison.\n\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\npointed end.)\n\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\n\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\ndo this.\n\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\nus alive.\n\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\nwhatever it takes.",

    "context": "\n\nThis brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much,\nand probably has not been studied much.\n\nAs some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on\npersonality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects\nof how churches have not properly understood personality variances among\ntheir members to the detriment of all.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.",

    "context": "The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\nunified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along\ntogether.\n\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\nbetter?\n\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\nshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\n\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\n   fellowship\n   communion\n   filling with awe for God\n   all having everything in common.\n   glad and sincere hearts\n   praising God\n   enjoying the favor of the people\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\n7:54-60).  \n\n\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is\ntotally sold out to God.\n\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\nI know I haven't.\n\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\nwould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\nwithin.  There's enough division without.\n",

Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \nthe historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary \nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \neven lunatic. \n\nAnd we still demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \npolitical pressure.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \n\nNow what would you do? \n\nSource: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nSerdar Argic",

Orthodox Jews?  \n\nAs to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains \nunproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often \nlook to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.\nFor agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so \nsure the atheists can be counted out. \n\nFor the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,\nor David in accepting God's Word?

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\n\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex\n plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\n the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained\n there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  \n\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n\n\t Unix:\tSunOS\n\t\t A/IX \n\t\t HP-UX\n\t\t Unicos\n\t\t DG/UX\n\t\t Ultrix\n\t\t SysV\n\t\t Linux\n\n\t Amiga/Exec\n\t MS-DOS\n\t OS/2\n\t NeXT\n\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\n\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\n\n CREDITS\n -------\n\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\n list all the contributors.   Those currently supporting and otherwise\n responsible for the package in its present form include:\n\n Maurice LeBrun\n Please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.

You have to\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\n\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm\nnot entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tder Mouse",

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener.

Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \n316 pages.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many\npeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various\npeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of\nthe quotations are derived from Cardiff's \"What Great Men Think of Religion\"\nand Noyes' \"Views of Religion\".\n490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\n\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\n\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\nnecessity, must be 1V.\n\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\n\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu",

They are largely out of order.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 11, 1992\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\n\n\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\n\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in\nJune.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\n\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992\n\nHm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bielecki\nwasn't released until the end of the year.  I won't comment on the\nbullpen.  (Jeff Reardon???  :-)\n\n\nRight on Blauser.  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on\nLonnie, as with Bielecki.  Didn't pick Sanders.  (Did anybody? :-)\n\n\nThree of them went, right?  Showalter is still around (and likely to\nstick, it seems).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFrom mattel.Auto-trol.COM!mattel@auto-trol.com Tue Mar 31 17:04:22 1992\n\nNope!  They won the division, and so kept him for a shot at the\nplayoffs.\n\n\n:-)  Well, they didn't finish last.\n\n\nGot that one right.\n\n\nNope.\n\n\nI guess this is why you picked the Mets to win, huh?\n\n\nTsk Tsk.

But I got the Pirates and Expos\nright!\n\n\nFirst half?  Dead on!  Second half?  Ummm....  I'm a Sox fan, go easy\non me!\n\n\nSo I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.  :-)  I\nwas at least *close*, and was right about Jefferies.  (Though I don't\nknow.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade?)\n\n\nClose.  No cigar.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSome predictions need no introduction!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSometimes us statheads get lucky.  Grace *didn't* hit behind Dawson\nthe entire season, but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNope.  He slowed down, and the injury finished him off.  Didn't\neven reach 50.  But a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom ECAXRON@MARS.LERC.NASA.GOV Thu May 21 16:42:21 1992\n\nThe Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though\nMussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).\n\n\nExcept for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The\nrest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians\n\"led\" with 76 wins, the Red Sox \"trailed\" with 73 wins.

Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this\npeople have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens\nand are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in\nthe Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are\nnot subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of\nGreek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in\nthe United States.\"\n\n\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights.

If your name is Turkish, you are\nnot hired to the government offices.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity\nin business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the\neconomic life of Greece.

I myself have been subject of a number of\nlaw suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself\na Turk.\"\n\n\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\"\n\nIn separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated\nthat the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of\nGreek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,\nhe said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)\nand only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not\nwant to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said\nthat Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out\nof the parliament as an independent representative and they stated\nthis fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification\nrequirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,\nthey imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including\nthe Turkish candidates.\n\nAhmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.\nHe earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.\nhe served in the Greek military as an infantryman.\n\nIn 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time\nby collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation\nof laws against ethnic Turks.

    "context": "[With Frank's permission, I have added some information here (and in\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\nprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\nControversy\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\n\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\n \n[SECOND CENTURY\n\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\nThus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\n\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\n\n\nTHIRD CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nDynamic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Theodotus\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\nconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\nsense of the word.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\n'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\na hypostatic union.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\nwithout beginning or end.\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\ndoctrine of salvation.\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\nChurch.  --clh]\n\n \nModalistic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Praxeas\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\n(Jesus Only)\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\nthe only unique and unitary God\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\nregeneration and sanctification.\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\n \n[I've moved the following description to be with the other\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\n\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\n\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\nthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\n\n\nFOURTH CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\n \nSource: Arius\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known\ncults\nPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\nhe is not of the divine essence.\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\n \nOrthodox Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Athanasius\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\nPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\neternal.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\nthe divine essence and function.\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\n\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

So, rather than be something secular, it is something\n SHK> very sacred.\n\nI would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment\nhas been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist\nworldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.\n\nThis is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid\ndestroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who\nare concerned about the environment. But at the time of the\nRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,\nor the focus of culture (hence \"humanism\"). This consciousness was\nalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the\npresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the\nsame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.\nThis doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it\nbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European\nsociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\njustified\n them.\n\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \"economics\" -\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \"the free\nrein of the market mechanism\", while for others it was \"the\ndialectical forces of history\". But in both the capitalist West and\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\noppose what was happening and state their case.\n\nSteve",

    "context": "1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.\n-------------------------------------------------\nKings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93\n\nThe third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against\nthe second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of\na non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.\n\nSymthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play\nover their last 9 games.\n\nThe teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.\n\nPlayoffs:\nCampbell Conference:\nSmythe Division:\nLA  6  @ CAL 3 \t\tLA leads 1-0\nWIN    @ VAN\n\nNorris Division:\nSTL 4  @ CHI 3\t\tSTL leads 1-0\nTOR    @ DET\n\nWales Conference:\nAdams Division:\nBUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)\tBUF leads 1-0\nMON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)\tQUE leads 1-0\n\nPatrick Division:\nNJ  3  @ PIT 6\t\tPIT leads 1-0\nNYI 1  @ WAS 3\t\tWAS leads 1-0\n\nRecords:\n--------\nvs\tSmythe\t Norris\t Patrck\tAdams\tOverall\n================================================\nHome:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 \nRoad:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0\n==============================================================\nTotal:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0\t0-0-0\t 1- 0-0  \n\nBox Score:\n=========================\nCalgary      0 1 2 - 3\nLos Angeles  1 3 2 - 6\n=========================\n\n1st period: \nLA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16\n    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25\n    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53\n    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34\n    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:30\n\n2nd period: \n    CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34\nCAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)\nLA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)\nLA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37\nLA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36\n    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53\n    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35\n    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40\n    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19\n    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31\n    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:03\n\n3rd period:\nLA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06\n    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24\n    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22\nCAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23\n    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08\n    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44\n    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19\nCAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47\n    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56\nLA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)\n    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38\n    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17\n    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17\n\nOvertime: none\n\nShots:\n------\nLos Angeles   8  9 14 - 31\nCalgary       5  8 11 - 24\n\nPower play conversions:\n-----------------------\nFor:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%\nAgainst:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%\n\nGoalies:\n--------\nLos Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)\nCalgary - Vernon (0-1-0)\n\nAttendance: 18,605\n\nScratches:\n----------\nRob Blake - back contusion\nGuy Leveque - numbers\nLonnie Loach - numbers\nMarc Potvin - numbers\nBrandy Semchuk - numbers\nRobb Stauber - numbers\nBrent Thompson - numbers\nJim Thomson - numbers\n\nLines - Forwards:\n----------------\n*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom \nDonnelly - Millen - Kurri\nRychel - Conacher - Taylor\nGranato - Carson - Shuchuk\n\nLines - Defense:\n----------------\n*Huddy - Sydor\nWatters - Zhitnik\nHardy - McSorley\n\n* denotes starting lineup\n\nNext game:\n----------\nWednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

That which is authoratative is authoratative,\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \nopen to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\nan authority. \n\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an \nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \n\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \nverify for himself.\n\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\n\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \n\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny\nGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\nnature, prove anything.\n\n\n",

As I mentioned in the Tradition\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\n\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\n     the same way?\n\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\n# who has been blind from birth.

In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\n\n\nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n",

The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.

From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\n\n\nCouldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\nto.\n\n\n\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\n\n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \nLook at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\ninteresting study.\n\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\n\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\n\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \"Egyptians.\"  He really\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\nEgyptians. \n\n\nI'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

Simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act. \n        If you do get feedback, negative or positive, from your congressional \noffice, please forward it to: David Anderman\n3136 E. Yorba Linda Blvd., Apt G-14, Fullerton, CA 92631,\nor via E-Mail to: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org. \n        Another resource is your local chapter of the National Space Society. \nMembers of the chapter will be happy to work with you to evaluate and support \nthe Back to the Moon bill.

As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)\npointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word \"believe\" to mean.\n\nUnfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak\natheism, at least according to the FAQ:\n\n# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n# often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\n# atheism\".\n# \n# It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\n# atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\n# atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\n(From mathew's \"An Introduction to Atheism\" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)\n\nShould the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of \"belief\"?\nCan it?\n",

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.",

A \nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900\n    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg\n    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.\n\n\nThe establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored\nby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nSerdar Argic",

I've got a problem that \nI need as many people's help from as possible.\n\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\n\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \n\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\n\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\n(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \nmention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later.\"\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her??

    "context": "Hi there netters,\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\nIs there such a thing as a 'justifible' war? \n\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \"All war  \nis wrong\", or \"Some war is justifiable\". \n\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \nhardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \npast and present. \n\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \nto God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \ntechnology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  \nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \nMig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \npilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  \neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\n\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.\n\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\n\n1. The Second World War\n\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\n\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \n\t\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n2. Korean war\n\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\n\t  communism vs. capitalism.\n\t- Probably not justifiable.\n\n3. Vietnam\n\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\n\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\n\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\n\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\n\t- Other factors such as genocide.\n\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\n\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\n\t- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'\n\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\n\t- Probably justifiable\n\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \nor Israel.\n\t- My feelings in this are simple\n\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\n\t- I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear\n\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\n\t- Never justifiable.\n\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I  \n*don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n==========================================================================\n                                    |\nAlastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347\nChief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529\nThe Black Albatross Porject,        |\nUniversity of Otago,                |\nDepartment of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz\nP.O.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\nweight whatsoever.",

If so, just how 'open' does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?",

Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.  For I am only\none person among many and the final word on \"Liberties and Rights\" cleary\nand irrevocably belongs to the many.",

I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe\nscience or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention.\nIt was from a company name \"Personal Missle, Inc.\" or something like that.\n\nAnyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length\nand engines of sizes \"F\" to \"M\".  They also said that some rockets will\nreach 50,000 feet.\n\nNow, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one\nof these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing\npeople to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.\nNot to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.\n\nAnd no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.\n\n\n-Paul \"mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite\" Dokas",

    "context": "\n\n\tTypical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person.\nThe bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago\n(as were all of the \"holy\" books). Follow the parts that you think are\nsuitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't\ntake it literally.\n\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\tSo you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist?\nThe Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in\nmy opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are \nintrinsically good (as against Christ's \"we are all sinners\").\n Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken \nourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. \n(In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist).\nBut to \"awaken\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat?\nCan you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday?\nBuddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? \nCan you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing\nto give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think \nJesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a \nphilosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). \nConsidering the fact that Christianity is a young religion\n(compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very\nprobable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.\n(There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the\nmiddle east at the time of Christ).\nAnd perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out (\"woman was created\nafter man, to be his helper\" etc).\naras\n\n\t\n\n\n\tWhen ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and\nother brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an\n1-800 number to turn in your pledges.\nGod it seems is alive and well inside these boxes.\n\n",

It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However,\nI intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.\n\n\nThis section is not in the letter that I received.

The \ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \nthe printer?\n \nThe Big question:\n\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\n\n\n\nPlease email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. \nI will post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

    "context": "I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of\nmite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot\nof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years\n(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.

Again, this is reposted with permission.\n\nTwo requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me\nand others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit\nkey.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such\nthat neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be\nimplemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and\nanother generates the second.  *That* is ominous.\n\nSecond -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they\ncarefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden\nmeanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper).\nLeave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES,\nwhich goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I\ndon't think you can impugn his integrity.\n\nOh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think\nsomething doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't\nunderstand their goals.\n\n\t\t--Steve Bellovin\n\n-----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\nTo: (a long list of folks)\n\nI was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to\nMarty's message:\n\n        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \n\nThe algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports\nall 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling\ncompared with 16 in DES.\n\n\tIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \n\tor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \n\tplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \n\nK is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method\n(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the\nAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key\nis negotiated using a public-key protocol.\n \n\tencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \n\tand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \n\tmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \n\tproducing\n\n\t     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nMy understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n\"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\nlaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\n\n        The unit key \n\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \n\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \n\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\nserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\nderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\nCompute the 64-bit block \n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] \n\n(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\ntwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\nthey're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\nconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\nthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\n\tauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \n\tdecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \n\tthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \n\tmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \n\nMarty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.\nPlease pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's\ncriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record\nof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions\nI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,\nLANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.\n\n\tWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \n\tenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \n\tflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \n\tthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \n\tcourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \n\tover which a message will flow.] \n\nMy understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it\nwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the\ncommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through\nthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.\n\n\tfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\n\tthe details so he could review the cases as required by\n\tlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\n\tover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\n        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \n        No single person or authority should have the power to\n        authorize wiretaps\n\nNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound\nof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain\nthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the\nAttorney General for final approval.",

    "context": "The primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\n\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\n\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\n\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\n\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\n\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.",

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters\nof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by\nobjective means.  \n\nChoosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal \nsovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)\n\n\n\ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu",

    "context": "The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period\nand the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.\nBrendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17\nseconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,\ncopyright San Jose Mercury news):\n\n---\n  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people\nand \nwounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and\nwounding \n75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in \nNabatiye.\n---\n  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off\n\nsouthern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command \nsaid.\n  \n     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the \nmotorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The\narmy \nsaid no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain \nguerrillas was not immediately known.\n---\n  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu\nNidal \nbattled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled \ngrenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.\n---\n Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had \nuncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said\npro-\nIranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.\n  \n     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the\ncatacomb-\nlike alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, \nKawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles\nsouth of \nBeirut.\n  \n     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt.

    "context": "I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

    "context": "\n\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n\n\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?\n\n\n\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE\nwho started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these\nare all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]\n\nBaltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)\nBoston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)\nDetroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)\nMilwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)\nNew York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)\nToronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)\n\nKansas City: George Brett (lock)\nMinnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)\nOakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)\nTexas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]\n\nCubs: Sandberg (lock)\nSt. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)\nNew York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain\n\t\t\t\t  \t      past form)\n[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]\n\nLos Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.\nSan Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)\nColorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)\n\n\t[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's\nprobably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include\nBarry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,\nMcGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before\n1985)]\n\n\tE-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here...\n",

The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the \"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>",

I, for one,\n: would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\n\n\nHear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\nestablish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\nstandard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\n\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\nbe to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\nphony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\n\nMeanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\nRSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\nit's a small price to pay.)\n\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\n*NOT* strong crypto!\n\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\nthat I said \"potential\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming\nmonths).\n\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\n\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\nto the Clipper system.\n\nOf course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\nmode.)\n\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\nwith RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\nlegal copy of \"MailSafe\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\n\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\n\n-Tim May\n\nP.S.

    "context": "Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n",

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your \nfixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \"missing\" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?\n\n\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add\nthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:\n        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)\n        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n\n\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so \nreferences to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the \nImakefile.

Remove the #include \nfrom sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line \n\t#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000\nThe file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied \nfrom another distribution.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?\nAll of the executables that I try to run have the following results:\n\tld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found\nor even:\n\tld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c\n\n\tIf you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you \nneed to run \"ldconfig\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've\ninstalled X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\n\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay. Check the man page for fbtab(5).\n\n[Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 106)  What is Imake?\n\n\tImake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a\nmakefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-\nprocessing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles \nsuitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n\t_XtTextReplace\n\n\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

It certainly is possible to severe the artificial\n  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us\n  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats \n  in this alien land.\"\n            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - \"Preserving the Armenian purity\") \n\n\n<1993Apr24.042427.29323@walter.bellcore.com>\nddc@nyquist.bellcore.com (Daniel Dusan Chukurov 21324)\n\n\nNo kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,\nmassacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly \npeople, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated \nthe entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between \n1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ntoday.\n\nA merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri \ntown of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to \nhave taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military \noperation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the \nArmenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been \nmassacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten \nand shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed \nthe Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian \ninsurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the\nKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City \nhospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant \nwere killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to \ncondemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its \nsovereignty.\n\nSerdar Argic",

I was afraid you would say that!\n\n\nWell, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it\nwould be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at\nleast in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.\n\n\nI can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\ngive him that dreaded \"seasoning\".\n\n\nSorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'\nera.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.\nAny info on that?\n\n\nIn other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind \na different decision than we would make must be financial.

Baseball\nis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping\nLopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.\n\nI happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from\nyour armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of\nevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among\nlarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I\nthink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly\nmore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have\nreleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It\nmay also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.\nSeems like pretty good common sense to me.\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n",

    "context": "The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\nThere are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the\nlight and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.\n",

That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be \nits own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.\n\nGod, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject \nto such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, \nGod's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence \nof a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the \nsupernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused \nphenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the \nsupernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very \nnature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.\n\nThis is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted \nto clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the \nnatural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being \ninterchangeable.",

According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves...

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...",

The dear old aunt (now \ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\ndevout.

Now, this\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\nJewish proselytism going on there.\n\nAnd again, last November I toured a \"traditional\" Jewish synagogue and was\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\ngeneral.

Tablets are\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\n\nMy \"clean your plate\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\nup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\n\nI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry\nshortly, and eating won't be practical then).\n\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\nmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\n\nThere's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\nit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.\n\nObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've\ndone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who\ndid try it and didn't succeed.\n\n\nI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes\noff again over a week or two.\n-- \nKeith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com",

Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\n\nnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\n\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\ninvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the\npeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our\nactions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is\nunrelated to anything to justify it for us.",

Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n\nJim replied by saying \n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\"Silence is concurrence\":  \n\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\n\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.

    "context": "A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.",

He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high\non the agenda of the U.S. administration.''\n\tThe importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren\nChristoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere\nelse in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term\nplan to station troops in the Gulf.\n\tMack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to\npressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''\n\t``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect\ncompliance,'' Mack told delegates.\n",

Quite likely, actually.\n\n                                                      [...I believe \"Jesus\n   only\" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who\n   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only\n   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have\n   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that\n   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the\n   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be\n   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or\n   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs\n   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't\n   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply\n   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]\n\nNot Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?\n\n(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on\nearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.",

For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.

If\n\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\n\t``CEC''.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\n\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\n\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\n\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\n\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won't kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\n\nSubject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\n\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\n\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\n\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\n\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\n\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny\" trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don't do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\n\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\n\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\n\n\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\n\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39\").\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\n\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\n\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\n\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\n\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\n\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n\t\t  ceiling\n\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\n\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\n\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\n\n\tComments on K&T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n\tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n\tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.",

    "context": "Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.

    "context": "Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n",

I guessed this would be  a basic condition\n      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)\n\nThe US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,\nthey're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services\noperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.\nAs Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,\nyou have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,\nand they generally can confiscate the equipment as \"evidence\"\n(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to\ndevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel\nyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password\nfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new\nsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.\nBut the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no\nlaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys\nfor their own files without giving them to you.\n\nEven in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.\nThere was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records\nsubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,\nso he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.\nThe US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,\nand these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,\nand neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they\nwere able to do much about it.\n\nIt might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers\nbased on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;\nit probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible\nextension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.\n\n",

The people of \nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \nMakarios.\n\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \nsince 1571. \n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\n\n            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM\n\n2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus\n\nIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at\nthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched\nagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat\nIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally\nkilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage\nGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\nhas been converted into a museum.\n\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\nGREEK TERRORISTS\n\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\n\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \n Date : 1 January, 1964. \n\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\n \n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\n\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

I doubt if a napalm bomb\nattack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick\nand concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately\nfired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted\nmass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey\nashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.\n\nIn the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 \nwrecked and burned out homes.

When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was\ntold by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return\nthe original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for\nreturning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.\n\nWell, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were\never returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \"Why we never\nreceived your old chips.\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had\nfollowed to return them, to which the person replied \"You mean you sent them\nUS Mail?\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was\ntold that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that\nI should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly\nwhat I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were\nabsolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted\nto trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to\nTechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)\nSales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them\nto \"make it right.\"\n\nI finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking\nthem to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously\nappeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with\nthe service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of\nknowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths\nto prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Of course,\nSwitzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small\ndistances between cities but still. \n\n\nDusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about\n7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built\nunless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. \n\n\nMalmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has \n5,000 seats I think.\n\n\nIf we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.\nTurku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for\nmajor league hockey.\n\n\n...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa\nto hockey fans.

The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor \nsport like hockey.\n\n\nThe easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.\n\n\nPerhaps . . .

London has\nbeen mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new\nmega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.\n\n\nNo facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 \nfans for hockey.

Last year at the\nliturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so\ntherefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but\nto no avail.\n\n\n   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\nis certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\ninnovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \"try\nsomething new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\n(\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\" according to one of our\npriests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one\nanother's hands.\n\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\nthe blood of this man.\"\n\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\nthat night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up\nprayers for our priests and parish).\n\n\n   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\nstill be \"liturgically\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from\npeople trying to be \"creative\" who are not.\n\n   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that\ngiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by\nthe title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \"They don't\nwant to\" because of all this nonsense.\n\n   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does\nnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are\ndisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \"authority.\"",

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.

You can also download code to the DSP\nsubunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in \nquestion [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own \nvocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.\n\nPaul",

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\npolice and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police\nhave stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of\nthe guns they conficate were illegally built.\n\n\nIt takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one\nof reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \npay someone anyway.

The blackmarket\nprices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least\nthose few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)\n\n\nWashington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled\nrifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten\ntimes the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\nand make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban \ncan not be easily side-stepped.\n\n\nSure.

Software is a _very_ bad\nexample for your case: How many people do you know with illegal\ncopies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and\nit isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually\nget it illegally.\n\n\nQuite.\n\n\n13-3-2.

The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm)\nand it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer\ncould just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the\npolice (the police are often corruptable, and things are known\nto disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and\nreappear on the streets...)\n\n\nPerhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs \nalso tried to invade Slovinia.

    "context": "\nActually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:\n\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \n\n\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\n\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\n\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\n\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\nof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\nperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must be\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's\n\"objective\" morality for us. \n\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \n\n\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\n\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\n\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\n\t'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall\n\tbe liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is\n\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\n\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\nseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\nwas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\nmorality.\" ",

Testing both methods side by side, they\nwere just about equal.\n\n  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous\nsizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your\napplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when\ndebugging SHM apps).\n\n  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.\nUltrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be\nattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes\nXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24\nbit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to\nsupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using\npixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to\nuse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one\ncopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).\n\n  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a\nGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick\nwhatever feels fastest.\n\n  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)",

The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)",

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\nappears, those of David Koresh.\n\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The\n\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\n\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\n\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\n\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\n\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\n\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\n#\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\n\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn't \"splinter\"\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\n\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\n\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\n\n#\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.\n\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\n\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\n\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\nof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\n\n#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\n\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \"orders\" (the late\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\nin Utah).\n\n#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\n#splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\n#\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a\n#man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with\n#the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.\n#\n#< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n#<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to\nhandle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington\nput it (whose name I forget), \"Congress has become everybody's city\ncouncil.\"\n\n       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than\nenough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its\noriginal jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.\n\n       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,\nbut that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically\nwanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem\nthen that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either\nHouse in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is\na system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more\nsense to make more decisions at a local level.\n\n\n       Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \"extraordinary\"\nmanner.\n\n\n       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were\nplaced on the veto.

Previous Presidents have used the veto\nfor any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their\nagenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President\nwho abused vetos.\n\n\n       Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators\nis the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators\nfeel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and \nfillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question\nas to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?\n\n       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which\ncovers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living\nin radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority\nbe required?\n\n       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power\nto ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not\nsee this as a positive thing.  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans\nare looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate\nobjections to the legislation in question.\n",

When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",

Reproduced without permission.]\n\n\n\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\n\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.

    "context": "        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no\nnotes so I'll try to wing it...  \n        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  ",

(ie downloading with Qmodem\nwith a DOS window open, and possibly POV running in the background.)  \n\nI've noticed that since I started using Windows a few months ago, lost\nclusters have gotten more and more common.  Although I don't like\nhaving data just disappear, it really haven't been a problem except\nfor today.  Has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while\nrunning windows?  And what could I do to fix the problem, I'd sleep\nbetter knowing Amy wasn't loosing her marbles. :)\n\nSteven",

    "context": "A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\nSince he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n",

And, much as it discomforts us, in\nhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and\ncranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.\nDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:\nmy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-\ngrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife\nhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\nfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of\nchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,\ncontain quite a few gravestones like \"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and\nbaby, May 6, 1853.\"\n\n\nMore like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have\ndirect experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.\n\n\nIt isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of\nreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.\n\nClearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine\ndesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  \n\n\nMy, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack\nin months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.\n\nWe're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although\nI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked\nthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.\nI wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly\nindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting\nuntil an emergency to give in.\n\nAnd bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.\nWe talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main\ndecisions were really hers.\n\n\nI don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that\na first-time mother should have her baby at home.\n\n\nBut people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was\nunwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.\nIn view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings\nhave much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem\nall lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious\npermanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,\nan esthetic consideration.",

We ran into one of my relatives at the \nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\nnear the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What's going on?\" He says, \n\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're \nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\n\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were \nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\nwere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice \nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and \nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\n\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was \nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \nmicrodistrict.\n\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\n\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We're in School No. 33, we need to be \nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\"\n\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\n\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \nout, we're here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that \nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That's what he did. He went down \nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\n\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\n\nIn the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, \nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\n\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \nthem.\n\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \nget the things any cheaper.\n\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \nfeelings, of course.\n\n   April 8, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

    "context": "This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\ndown the Mediterranean.\n\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the \"Black Madonna\" doesn't represent\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\nBuehler....?)\n\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\nthere are the Ethiopians....\n\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\npeople are \"white\" (i.e., of the racist's \"race\").  If I may risk a\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\nantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \"Jesus was white\" thesis\never played the roles that some hold it did.\n\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.",

    "context": "\nMy votes (FWIW):\n\nTeam MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.",

Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,\nwhere the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure\nof better. The concept is called \"context\", and you should really become\nfamiliar with it someday.\n\n\nUnless this transaltes to \"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to\nthe Jays,\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\n\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race.

Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why?

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

    "context": "\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n\tAndy\n\n\n\n-- ",

The notion that coercion can\nbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is\neliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious \nconsideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  \n\nFor example, does \"non-initiated force\" (coercion) include tax collection?\nDoes it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned\nby Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the\nstate, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the\nfact arbitration/legal compulsion?  \n\n\nWell, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants\nis somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a \ncomplex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out, \nhowever, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group \nof \"seminar participants\" to \"embrace\" their philosophy, their \npropaganda skills need to be honed.  \n\nFrankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a \nsociety in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper\ngovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities\ncan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,\nthe state will just wither away.  \n\nOn the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating \nvirtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the \ncurrent society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like\nsocialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until \neveryone has had the benefit of \"re-education\" through regular \n\"seminar\" training?\n\njsh\n",

This could be substantially\nthe same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the\npolice could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-\nissued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped\nmessages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could\ngenerate a new key pair and go about your business.

Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.",

Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.

    "context": "There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program\nabout Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\n\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\n\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\n\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\n   outlaw state.\n\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\n   perhaps intensify.\n\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\nbeen behind this. These include:\n\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\n\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\n   sources from this region.\n\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\n   Soveit Union.\n\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .",

    "context": "\n   [...]\n\nI think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.\nI don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such\n\"storys\" about them. OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\n         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with\n         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \nStates Bill Clinton.\n\t     \n\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \nfound not guilty.\n\t     \n\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \nadministration and what you're trying to do.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\n\t     \n\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\n\t     \n\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \n\t     \n\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \nviolence and drugs.\n\t     \n\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \nproblems as we do.  \n\t     \n\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \nbattle?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n\t     \n\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \nto a vote.\n\t     \n\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n\t     \n\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \nhis office lately?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \nof the budget I presented.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \nputting the American people back to work.  \n\t     \n\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \nthe need for jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have some questions from people who supported \nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \nit was going to be like this.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \nwide range of things.  \n\t     \n\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \nreal, real progress.  \n\t     \n\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \nthings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Thank you very much.  \n\t     \n\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.

    "context": "I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\n\n\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \ninteraction\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).\n\n\t6.Review Article, \"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment \nof renal calcium stones\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\n\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \nguess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney \nstones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought \nI'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th Street\nTulsa, Ok. 74107",

I'll only add that I\nthink perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,\nthough your usage is quite valid.\n\n\nI'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way\nreduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or \ndescribes things we can observe.\n\nNot to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't\njust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution\nis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a \nclarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of\nevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.\n\nI'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger\nabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_\nproposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves\nare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not \nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \n\tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\n        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't\n\tmuch to say.\n\nDo you agree?\n",

The team has a guaranteed two-year lease with\nthe arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.\n\n\"It's not our choice\", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said\nabout ruling out the arena as a long term option.  \"The NHL told us we \ncan't stay there.  It's not economically feasible.\"\n\nOne reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox\nand advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit\npotential.\n\nThe hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade, \nand Palm Beach counties.\n\nA leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents\n10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending\nan eight-year battle of wills.\n\nCompliments of the News/Sun-Sentinel.\n\nJim G.",
