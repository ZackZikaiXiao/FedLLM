    "context": "\n\n       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's\nviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our\nnon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\ncontrol laws.\n\n       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\n\n\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the\nquestion of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \"magically\"\nkeep the guns out, but now isn't.)\n\n\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \"illegal drugs\"\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \nI've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\nwell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\n\n\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\n\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\nsame conditions.\n\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\nthen we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\nlower.\n\n\n\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \"inner-city\"\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\nis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\nthey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\nthe early eighties.\n\n\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\n\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\nviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it\nwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\ncan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\n\n\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\nof gun control.\n\n\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\nsell to them?",

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.",

    "context": "\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.",

Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown\n    by the Graphite and #9GXE's \"cheating\".  Can't they just admit that\n    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach\n    is much harder to beat...\n\n2.  The big \"cheat\" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and\n    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't\n    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing\n    PC Magazine says is that scores are not \"legitimate\" -- couldn't they\n    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?\n\nI'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve\nGibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx\n\n    \"Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world\n     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than\n     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's\n     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I\n     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the\n     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB.\"\n\nThis kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench\nor not!  :)\n\n\nI already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and \nseven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an\noriginal ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in\nmy 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where\nyou use BitBlits).\n\nHercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you\ncan buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At\njust $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth\ntrying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post\nmy impressions when I get it...\n",

Security Council Resolution 713 of \n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\n  \n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \n  allies.\n  \n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\n  \n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \n  \n                                more\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \t     \t       \t    (OVER)\n\f\n                                  2\n  \n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\n  \n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tSincerely,\n  \n  \n  \n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tWILLIAM J.

If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read.\n(Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)\n\n\n...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting\nit across?

The Bible is far\nfrom universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\nit is only a proof that some people have thought that there\nwas a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\nwriting it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\ncase of Dionetics.)

It doesn't stop exerting a direct and\nrationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the\nother hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except\non the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence.\nGravity is obvious; gods aren't.\n\n\nNo, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of\n\"God\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \"god\".\nIn other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian\ngod, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much\nof oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as\nthe idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\nare and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\nhuman nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\nbe and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\ntendancy to believe in \"God\" only exists in religious wishful\nthinking.\n\n\nXtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and\nit's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence.\nDivine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already\nbelieve in the divinity.\nFirst, not all atheists believe the same things about human\nnature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not,\nYOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at\nthe least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric\napproach.

If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.

When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

    "context": "April 16, 1993\n\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\n\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\n\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\nDaniel J. Weitzner, Senior Staff Counsel (djw@eff.org)\n\nFull text of the Press releases and Fact Sheets issued by the\nAdministration will be available on EFF's ftp site.",

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \nThe document below is the result of that effort. \n\nDorothy Denning\n---------------\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                                April 19, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP STRUCTURE\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n16 Mbits a second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\nencrypted under the family key F.\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMikotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\n\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\nassurance that no information is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies.\n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\n",

    "context": "\nGee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something \nI say can't be all bad.  ;-)\n\nSeriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \nI still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \nis mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your \ncontention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \"scientific\" \ncan possibly know what's true and what's not.  \n\n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

For instance, Paul talks about the\n\"super-apostles\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions\nhow people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2\nThessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will\nabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will\nsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).\nSuch passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them\n(Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse\n14:  \"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world\nas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\"  Even today,\nthere are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar\nwith:  the non-need of baptism and the \"praying of Jesus into your life\nfor salvation\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been\ntaken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just\nplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and\nLuke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The\nchurch Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being\npersecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is\nbeing persecuted.\n\nJoe Fisher",

I am currently working\non a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with\nPhoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU\nwith UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and \nTerminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong\nwith the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to\naccess the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C\ncode that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that\nwill be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.\n\nI have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code\nthat I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I\nam doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack\nof knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.\nI wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and\nthen to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, \nthe LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do\nnothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses\nthe bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt\nint86() function in dos.h.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\narticle, if possible.\n\n\nI didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\nregardless.\n\n\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\n\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.

    "context": "First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers\nto my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\n\n\n\n\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\nescape your notice. \n\nThe correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\nbut not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.\n\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\n'best fits' for the data. \n\n\n\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\nDisbelievers are not punished. \n\n\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \n\nYes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not\nchange my situation. \n\n\n\n\n(deletions)\n\n\n\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \n\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \n\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\n\n\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\nleave open the question \"why this, and not that\", and this is where\ntheistic explanations come in.\n\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.\n\n\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\nno meaning in His case. \n\nIf I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. \nFrom our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\n\n\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\nto admit, but I am patient.\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\ntell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \n\n\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\nare inside it. \n\n\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\nknowable?\n\n\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\nmy faith on. \n\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \"why do I believe\"\nor \"why I don't believe\". \n\nPetri\n",

But this\nstrategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\nin the near term.)\n\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\n\nNote that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically\nfeasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.\n\nWhile I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\nget to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\nteller machines, don't we?\n\nAnd then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\nafter.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\n\nAnd hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\n\nAfter all, if you're not doing anything illegal...\n\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \nI can't imagine why.\n",

    "context": "Dear Netters:\n\nI am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.\nQuestion is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the\nApril Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!\n\nIn particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,\nand brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine\nownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one\nstuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something\nabout sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem\ntoo bad if one \"beats\" on his car.\n\nI am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems\nyou have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can\nanyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any\nproblems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.\n\nThanks for any responses!",

    "context": "\nIf we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the\nproblem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy\nand reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.\n\nYeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his\nGorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress\nand calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through\nand we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the\nanti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in\nhiding.\n\n\nIf they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However,\nI think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach.\nThis is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like\n'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do\nanything.'\n\nDespite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting\nfarther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if\nwe had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the\nproblem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.\n\nRight now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.\nThere are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy\nProton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to\nhelp a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles.\nInstead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to \ntear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.\n\nWell, I think limited government is primarily democratic due\nto it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform\na state-run economy and monolithic government into something that\neven remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government \nis trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be\npainless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to\nhelp when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never\nget there without the aid.  It may be too late already.\n\n\nAnd I'm just excercising mine.\n\n\nAs I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*.\nA Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.\nI have seen nothing about how to take our current government and\nsociety and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible\nself-sufficient populace.  \n\n\nThey didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous\ncommunications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in\nless than a day.\n\n\nYes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers\ndo emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of\nevery person on the planet.  \n\nThere must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when\nit gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of\nbounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market\nis, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of\ngovernment.  ",

Now the\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\nsinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as\nwould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"",

I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \nthe initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a \nservice bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you \nmay be able to get your dealer to fix it.\n\n\nHaven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the\nmailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.\n\n\nDefinitely!\n\n\nNo problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious \nplaces where they screwed up.\n\n\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \"credit card\" key that \ncame in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\ndoesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))\n\n\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up\nall the space where you'd expect to find the horn.\n\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\nof those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\n\n\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\n\n\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\nsound.\n\n...\n\nYes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.

No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\n\n\nI haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\n('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like\nthis concerning the '93 Probes.\n\nI haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\n\nFrom what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.

Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.",

Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\n\"reasoning\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British \"water and bread\" that\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\nethnic-state).

Certainly this\nwas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being\nlikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\nconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\n\n\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The\nchassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\n\n\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\nare referring to).\n\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\n\n\nThey don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\nindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we\nwon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\ndon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\n\n\nBut surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\nperiod?

Supported, and parts available,\nyes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!\n\n\nI missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your\nfrustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might\nhave an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't\ngoing to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we \nhear similar things from more than one person/site).\n\nAll of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.",

    "context": "\n\nI don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.\n\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.",

    "context": "Archive-name: rec-autos/part5\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted\nto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]\n\n   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as\n    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]\n\n                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions\n\n\nTire Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?\n\nA:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the\n    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually\n    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.",

Again from my Mac & IBM info\nsheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the\ninfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some \n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\n\nIBM\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\n[...]\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\n\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}",

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n\nThe Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\nProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.",

You're talking about averages, when we\nhave lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our\ndecisions on.\n\nI might as well say \"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet\ntall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\"\n\n\nWhy isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after\nadjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an\nabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.\n\nAs for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't\nbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\nseason?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to\nuse.\n\n\nThe point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he\nhadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager\nto question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him\ndown \"until he gets warmed up\".\n\n\nMost players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do\nwith Javy Lopez?\n\n\nSee above.  \n\n\nBut I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most\nplayers aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year\neither.\n\n\nAnd demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.\n\n\nNot superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're\nbeing charitable.\n\n\nUmmm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year\nin his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a\nbig question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and\nhas rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable\nbat... for a shortstop.\n\n\n\nWanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be\n20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player\nwith experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.\n\n\nJust like Keith Mitchell did?\n\n\nThat was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\nreally don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\nor some combination of the two.

    "context": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\n\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\n\nDear Shai,\n\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\nserves no other purpose ?\n\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.",

We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft\nunits.\"\n\nTurkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the\nconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which\nmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to\nAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.\n\nA Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly\non a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket\nlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.\n\nDuliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops\nand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where\nthey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.\n\n\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the\ncountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\" he said.\n\nArmenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops \ninvolved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.\n\nTass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive\nalong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.\n\n\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent\ninspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)\nleadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\" the agency said.\n\nArmenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in\nKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of\nCommonwealth leaders.\n\n\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the\nprotection of the Karabakh population,\" Tass quoted him as saying.\n     \nAt least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have\ncollapsed.\n\n\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the\nlegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\" he\nsaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not \nbeen recognised by any other country.\n\nArmenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future\npeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.\n\nLocal news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender\nGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with\nArmenia, had resigned.\n\nTuran news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.\nKhabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of\nBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.

A6 \n======================================================================   \n\"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program\" AIDS \nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \n\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses \nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\f\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n",

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete\nfor physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and \nundermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.\n\n\nOnce again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney\ndialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services\nto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.\nOtherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the\nvast expansion that has occurred.\n\n\nCan you spell \"loss leader?\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \n\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\n\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \n\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \"government\nbureaucracy\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\nshould take such such cases into account.\n\njsh\n",

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.

Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, 'twere not so.

    "context": "\n\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\nsentence.\n\n\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\n\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\n\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.\n\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\n\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\n\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\nwith the following contextual modification:\n\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\n\n-----\n\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.",

    "context": "\nI agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n\nI can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.\n       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few \n       adults respond to this treatment.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n-- ",

The big problems I have encountered in\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\n\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\n\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\n\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\n  between MSC and BC).\n\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\n  references).\n\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's\nhype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.\n",

Snatches of the court's decision:\n\nThe Second Amendment was intended to \"assure the continuation and render \npossible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be \ninterpreted and applied with that end in view.\"\n\nThe militia includes \"all males physically capable of acting in concert \nfor the common defense.\"\n\nHowever, regarding sawed-off shotguns, \"certainly it is not within \njudicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military \nequipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n\n\"Judicial notice\" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such\nevidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming\nthat they had ruled that it wasn't.\n\n\nI'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-\nbarrelled (\"sawed-off\") shotguns in war.\n\nCompare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American \nWar; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by\nUS soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to \"tunnel rats\" \nin Vietnam, but, of course, \"Miller\" took place in 1939.\n\n\nHere is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of \nguns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument \nunless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs\nin that class.  \n\nI think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe \nwe also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments \nhave been banning or trying to ban because they have \"no sporting purpose\" \nand \"no provate citizen would ever need these guns\" DO fall under the \nprotection of the Second.  \n\nSo, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at \nsome time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship \ntraining purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing \nthis point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.\n\n\nOften, what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him.\nHow much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago?\nHow many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago?\n-- ",

    "context": "Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that\nthe government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only\nused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\nencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\nstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\neasy-to-break inverters.\n\nNote that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\nBefore we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\ne-mail and files, let's focus on this.\n\nOne question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\nlimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\n\nThough I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\nless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\nsecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\neavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\ncordless phones.\n\n-------\n\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\n\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\ndepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\nescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\n\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\npursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\ncommunications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\neavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\n\n------\n\nIn discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\nnoise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,\nand personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.\n",

The US has the power to go into any country\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\nUS see fit.

    "context": "------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------\n\nYou've heard about Apple's great new customer \"support\" program.  Well,\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You'll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\nto stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.",

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

    "context": "Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:\n\n\n\nIn these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a\ncourt order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal\nwiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the\nsystem of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?\n\nThe second section shows the sequence of events.\nThe law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the\nline with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope\nwith digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are\ntalking analogue telephony here).\nWhat next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\nbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later\nit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units\n(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.\n\nHow tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\nline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised\nspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to\nadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.\n\n\nThis raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect\nanything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body\ncalled BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,\nthat they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know\nif this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.\nPerhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get\nto fish in the escrowed key pool as well.\n",

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\n\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\n\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\n\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC",

The most recent expansion \ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \nbetween forwards and defensemen.\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\n \n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\n\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\n \n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \nthe NHL?\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \nchances.\n \n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \nassistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in \nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\n\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \nColonial Hockey Leagues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n9.

Congressional\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \nprojects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\nto Congress.  It didn't work.)\n\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\nat what level.\n\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \nRepublicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \npackage for ALL projects.  \n\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\npriorities.\n\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\n\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \n\nIs it clear now?

What is important is HOW they are used, and what \n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\n\n\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \n          at a time, preferably grapes. \n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \n          clean the intestinal linings. \n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \n          your home bathroom.) \n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \n          Drink one glass per hour.\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \n          PULP.] \n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n      \n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \n        \n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \n          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \n          prepare it and drain it.\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \n          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \n          present at those times).\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \n       \n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \n       \n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \n               about 2 months. \n        \n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \n\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \n               day.\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \n\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \n\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \n               several times per day.\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \n               described above. \n\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \n\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \n               magnetic fields. \n\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \n\n               INTERFERON tablets.\n\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \n           \n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \n               problems (even drug addiction!). \n\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \n               prostate trouble. \n\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \n\n\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \n          effectively. \n\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \n          a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \n          to CURE the cancer. \n\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \n          \n          \n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\n\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\n\n\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \"sin\" on\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n\nI think you are begging the question.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n- - ---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?",

Most of the C preprocessors that\n        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n        start of a directive. \n\n        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n        that \"This\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n        fix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.

Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.\nIt is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. \nI thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe\non the same God, \"the God of Ebrahim\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?\nHow are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them \nwould distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same\nGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?\n\n\nMan kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.\nA religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.\nThe praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes\nthat God will help him when he prays.\nReligion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the \nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his\ncut too! \n\nIs in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other\nhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts \nthat we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will\nsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop\nanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would\nto come its senses, before it is too late?\n\n\nP.S. on the side\n\nDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\n\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \n\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\n\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\nplotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward\neach other.",

By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. \nWhatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others. \n\nRegards,",

    "context": "-*----\n\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\n \n\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\nloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \n\n\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \n\n\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\ngospel.\n\n\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out. ",

The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we \nshould accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd.

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.

Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.

I\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\nhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.\n\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\n\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\n\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\nthrough prayer.  \"I'd like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I'm\nno longer deserve it.\"\n  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There's no reality\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men.\"\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\n  \"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore.\"\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, \"They'll do anything to reach these people.\"\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\"\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow,\" \"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\n  \"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse.\"\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  \"I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community.\"\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.",

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by\nthe Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of\nthe Chruch to do so.\n\nAndy Byler\n\n[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church\nestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is\nthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the\nceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based\non Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'\nteachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship\noccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these\npoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more\ntime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are\nright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.\n\nAccepting the principle of \"sola scriptura\" does not commit us to\nobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite\nclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is\non where the Bible would have us place the line.\n\nBy the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters\nthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to\ndetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that\nthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship\nfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or\n(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to\ndecide.",

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******",

The socio-economic factors which we know help \nto produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large \nproportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we\nsomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is \nlaid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But \nnobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has \nsocioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a \ndysfunction.\n\nBasically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that\nsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to\ndeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african\namericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be\nthat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has\na very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.\nNon african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they \nare so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good \nhard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it \nwerent' so damn typical.",

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\n \n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\n  aid remailer use).\n\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\n  -----------------------------\n    Anonymized mail.

Request information from above address.\n\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \n  -----------------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site\n    address for information.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n  \n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\n    are wholly unresolved.\n  \n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \n\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n    vary between sites.\n\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\n\n_____\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\n\n  \n  Users\n  -----\n\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n    network traffic.\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n    hierarchy is preferred.\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n    future ones under the same handle.\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.\n  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\n\n  Operators\n  ---------\n\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\n    lassaiz-faire?\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\n    users trust you to protect them.\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\n    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\n    your commitment to it?\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\n    possible, query group readers.\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\n    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\n\n  Readers\n  -------\n  \n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\n    offend you personally.\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\n    idea of anonymity itself.\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or\n    `conceivable' need exists.\n\n  References\n  ----------\n  \n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\n\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\n  > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system\n  > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of\n  > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a\n  > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of\n  > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.\n\n_____\n<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?\n\n  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:\n\n  > Try putting this in your kill file:\n  >   \n  >   /Anon/h:j\n  >   /Anonymous/h:j\n  > \n  > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that\n  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't\n  > kill followups. \n  \n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\n  \n_____\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\n\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n  \n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n  against it. \n\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\n  created.''\n\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\n  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.\n  \n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\n  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\n  anonymity is also controversial.\n\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\n  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating\n  through many newsgroups. \n  \n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\n  detractors.\n\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\n  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\n  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\n  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\n\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\n  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\n  \n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\n  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\n  etc.\n\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\n  software to the public domain.\n\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\n  encryption.\n\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.\n  \n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\n  contributions here.)\n\n\n_____\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\n\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\n    \n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\n  > content of one's message.

It is not comprehensive,\n##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it\n##for you through interlibrary loan.\n##\n\n  I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)\n\n##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre-\n##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\nyour mouth either). \n\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\n\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\nbe scientific treatises.

On the one hand they wish to distort the truth\nand on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.\n\n        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92\n\n        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday\n\n        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be \n        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian \n        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. \n\n        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the \n        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of \n        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 \n        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the \n        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in \n        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were \n        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I \n        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift \n        hospital in a string of railway carriages. \n\n        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by \n        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov \n        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to \n        his  town.   \" So where are the rest?\".  Some might have  taken \n        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the \n        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to \n        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of \n        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. \n\n        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at \n        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting \n        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. \n        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored \n        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend \n        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the \n        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. \n\n        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken \n        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that \n        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack \n        Khojaly. \"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\" \n\n\nSerdar Argic",

    "context": "I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret,\nand some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be\nwrong.....) \n\nfrom \n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n                               Dorothy Denning\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\nvalues:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\n\n------------------\n\nsuppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but\ndid not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from\nif law enforcement field \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F]\nnot knowing N would might make this much harder.\n\nNow suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),\nIf I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U\nfor a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the\nother party.\n\nIf I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could\nmake my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also\nallows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are\nsaying but I could know who you are saying it too.\n\nNow I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of\nmessages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key\ngeneration method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that\nmatter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be\nchosen from know weak keys for the system.\n\nObviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement\nfor whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that\nit is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of\npeople (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \"panel of experts\" is\ngoing to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget\ngrinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.\n\nSo, am I wrong? Or are these problems.",

We were  \nhaving intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me  \nif you have seen this before...\n\nShould Christians fight?\n\nLast week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there  \nare such things as \"justifiable wars\". I have started looking into these  \nthings and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  \nhis questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  \ntack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  \nsome more info soon.\n\nOur duty to our neighbour:\n\nDo good to all men (Gal 6:10)\nLove our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)\n\nAct the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  \ntrouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  \nman, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  \npeople harm (even medical corps of the army etc).\n\nChristians are by faith \"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\"  \n(Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \"God rules in the kingdoms of  \nmen\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  \nof those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.\n\nWe are to be \"strangers and pilgrims\" amongst the nations, so we are just  \npassing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  \n(this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  \nare not supposed to \"strive\" or \"resist evil\" (even \"suffer yourselves to  \nbe defrauded\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  \npreserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  \nGod's kingdom.\n\nOur duty to the state.\n\n\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  \nthe things which be God's\" (Luke 20:25).\n\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  \nbut of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  \nthe power, resisteth the ordinance of God\" (Rom 13:1-2).\n\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  \nit be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  \nye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)\n\nThese scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  \ndivine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  \nordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  \nit. The reason for this is that we are God's \"bond servants\" and His  \nservice is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  \n3:22-23 where bondservants were to \"work heartily as unto the Lord\" - so  \nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \"Pressed down, shaken  \ntogether, and running over\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\n\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  \nnot fighting in the battle, but is \"testifying\" to the truth.\n\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \"fellow  \ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\", and are no longer  \ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to \"lay aside every weight\" that we may  \nrun \"the race that is set before us\", and if we are wise, we will discard  \nany association which would retard our progress - \"Thou therefore endure  \nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \nchosen him to be a soldier\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\n\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is \"be ye not unequally yoked  \ntogether with unbelievers\". One of the obvious applications of this is  \nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \nservitude, and Jesus says \"take my yoke upon you\", so we are then yoked  \nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \"become not ye the  \nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\n\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \n\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\". The situation here is a good  \nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \"sold himself to work  \nwickedness before the Lord\" (1 Kings 21:25).\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \n\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \nyoking.\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  \nassociation he had made.\n\nGod says to us \"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \ndaughters\" (2 Cor 6:17).\n\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  \nit, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\n\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\n\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\n\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\n\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\n\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\n\nAll that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \nmaster.\n\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \nanyone but God.\n\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  \n10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).\n\nI'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  \nfurther.\n",

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com",

Despite its small size and quickness,\n+  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n+  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n+  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n+  \n+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n+  \n+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n+  \n+  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n+  \n+  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\n   any specified angle.\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\n   region of an image.\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\n   keyword values for a set of images.\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive\n   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical\n   aperture shape to image isophotes. \no  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot\n   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`\n   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,\n   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and\n   adjust cursor size on image.

    "context": "\nFor the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?",

See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \nLane Fox writes, \"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' \ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\"\n\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \nPagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \"A comment *attributed* to\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\n\nSo far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: \n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \nI don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\norginally developed (does anyone?).\n\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \ndidn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\nincorporate theology).\n\nCan't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \ncertainly not foreign to religions.

Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n\"cheap\").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\n\nI think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.",

    "context": "Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

    "context": "Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.\n\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\n\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\nwhich is now ready to work.\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\nand the session key. This might look like\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\n\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\nBit's.\n\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\n\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\n\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\nchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\nHow about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\nthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\nthis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\nafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\nbut I guess politics will not work that way.\n\nApparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\nof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\ncept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\nthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\nis allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\ncations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\nto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\nas I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\ncompany, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\nwill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\nby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\n\nWhat do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\nfirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\nkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\ndifficult to do *that* :^)\n\nAnd now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about\nClipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems\nto have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!\n\n\nNow an afterthought to your rights.

    "context": "Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\n\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.",

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.\n\n",

I cannot\naccept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I\nurge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect\nthreats.\n\nPS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with\nthe search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that\njustice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967\nare not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called\npragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can\nnever be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.\nIt is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the\nlaw, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not\nnormal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than\nWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to\nmarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have\ndrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to\ncompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy\nendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day\nwill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,\nin which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic\naffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any\nmore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their\ntraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western\ndemocracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that\nmost\nAmerican Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed\nChristian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.\n\nI would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views\nand personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile\noutbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect\nJudaism are uncivilized.

I know the bible well. So well\nI can recognize many passages from memory.  \n\n<<****Strong opinions start here...****>>\n\n1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced\nmental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to\nexplain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed\nthat Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due\nto the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  \n\nChristianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are \nbecause 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life\na safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is \nfollow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\"\nFor all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"\n\nbut i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\ninfectious nature.

We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\ndie.      \n\nReligion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\nSome people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject\nthemselves with jeezus and live with that high. \n\nIt pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious\nwars, of which Christianity has had no small part.\n\nWhen Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind\nto the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live\nwith this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 \nwho happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans\nwere (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities\nneeded some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time\nof dire need.\n\nI must go.

I am not\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\n\tWhile the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\nreading the Bible.\n\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\n\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\n\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\nreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being\na Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in\nsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by\nthe person of Jesus Christ.",

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver\nwith other similarly configured computers.\n\nI am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.\n\nThe problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start\nchanging themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open\na full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have\nany problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially\nreturn to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.\n\nAlso, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the\ndesign on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but\nthe white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.\n\nThe color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark\npurple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the\nscreen gets refreshed again.\n\nIf I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell\nnetwork, everything is fine.\n\nI originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the\nother machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this\nmachine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine\nand the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried\nreloading Windows to no avail.\n\nAny thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!",

    "context": "ZOROASTRIANISM\nSAN JOSE, CA, USA\nMonday April 5, 1993\nSan Jose Mercury News, Page 1\n     [Reproduced without permission]\n\n_3,700-year tradition still glows - \n           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_\n\nBy Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer\n\n   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a\ngleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -\ndedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.\n\n   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that\ntheir faith will survive this land.\n\n   \"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.\n\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\"\n\n   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.\nBut for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.\n\n   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep\nit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \"historical sites\" are\nsometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\nZoroastrian prophet.\n\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\npeople is very much on their minds.\n\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\n\n   \"It's important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It's important\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\n\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n\n_Good vs. evil_\n\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\n\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\nwhere others had no rights.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\nthis continent.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\ncommunity center.\n\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\n\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\ncame to worship and revel.\n\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\nproved him right.\n\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\nand nuts.\n\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\n\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\n\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\n\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\nplayed a tambourine.\n\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\n\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\npeople's religion.\n\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\n\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n\n   \"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\ndifference with the lower animals?\"",

    "context": "\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\npositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.",

(I might be a little off on the title, but he \n->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity, \n->in the process he became a Christian himself.\n\nSounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he \nbelong to? Does it have a name?\n\n->\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a \n->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.\n\nLogic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been\nthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not \nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\n\n->\tSome reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would \n->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \n->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \n->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did \n->heal people.  \n\n\nLogic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't\nmean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\nHe has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \nhe believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\n\n->\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \n->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \n->this right away.\n->\tTherefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \n->real thing.  \n\n\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\nall other possible alternatives.\n\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\n\n->\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \n->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \n->write I will use it.\n\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \nfullfilled them anyway.\n\n->\tI don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's \n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \n->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \n->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a \n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But \n->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \n->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \n->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \n->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this \n->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be \n->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \n->ourselves.  \n\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \nXians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.

    "context": "\nThen don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on\nPC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.\n(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)\nAre you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when\ncompared to IDE?\n\n\nI get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.\n\n\nIDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's\nhow it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be\nan all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different\nplatforms.\n\nIs there any argument that \nIDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the\ndrive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able\nto deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because\nof a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?\n\n\nIf data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to\nperform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main\nmemory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE\ncan't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored\nin main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives \nat the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the\nsame time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?\n\n\nA friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245\nmillion bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets\nclose to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?\n\n\nSo you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,\nconsidering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or\ntape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\nat the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years\nago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that\nprevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.\n\n\nBut on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you\nget more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have\na single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI\nchoice really give them more performance than IDE?\n\n\nTrue, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option\nis there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.\n\n\nNo argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the\nbest reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer\neventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single\nhard drive system?\n\n\nWith all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that\nPC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, \nis the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/\npartitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?\n\n\nSo the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this\nreally a problem?  \n\n\nAfter having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,\nI have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor\nhave I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or\nto/from the same drive.\n\n\nThat is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that\nthere is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.\n",

    "context": "\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n",

A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor.

What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford",

    "context": "Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that\nwas a pretty nifty idea.  Then President Clinton said he wanted families\nwho make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many\nwere quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one\nof the well-to-do.  It's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those\ntraditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the\nwealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of \"just\nregular working-class folk\".\n\nNobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class.  So who\nare The Rich?  Well, I'll throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and\nlet you be the judge...\n\nVa negvpyr <mzimmersC5E1qK.Fn9@netcom.com>\nmzimmers@netcom.com (Michael Zimmers) jevgrf:\n} In article <1qcdvbINN5ti@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov>\n} > [...]\n} >that would be about $55 to 65 thousand US, and that is what tenured\n} >professors can expect to make.  For a PhD with say 10 years experience,\n} >$65,000 is a lot less than what he could be making in industry.  \n} \n} Oh?  As a 12-year veteran of Silicon Valley, I've seen precious few\n} employment ads that call for PhDs.  And $65K is hardly chump change;\n} it's well above the median *household* income for the state.\n\nBay Area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range.  National\naverage is $31,889.  The Bay Area has nearly twice the national average\nof six-figure income households (9.1% vs 4.8%*).  The cost-of-living here\nmay be high, but I don't think it's twice the national average...\n\n} >In Los Angeles, modest home prices can be $500,000.  \n\nA 1,500-square-foot tract house in a Bay Area working-class neighborhood\ngoes for about $250,000.  I doubt that the Los Angeles market is all that\ndifferent.  It would appear that this definition of \"modest\" is perhaps a\nbit immoderate...\n\n} So what?  They're no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed.\n} \n} >In California, $65,000 is not upper-middle-class.\n} \n} It depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average.\n\nIt is more than what two-thirds of California households make.  Seems\nto me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable\ndefinition of \"upper-middle-class\".  Note that if that professor's\nspouse earns $35,000 they become one of Clinton's \"rich\" families.\n\nHere's a breakdown of national, California, and Bay Area household incomes:\n\n   <$30K  $30-50K   $50-100K  $100K+\n------------------------------------\nUS  49%     24%        23%      4% * the Census Bureau did some weird\nCA  41%     26%        26%      7%   rounding here...more like 5%\nBA  34%     25%        31%      9%\n\nAnd to add a little prespective:\n\nA minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year.  The poverty\nline for a family of four is $15,171.  If they make up to twice that, the\ngovernment considers them to be \"working poor\".  Say we decide to call this\nthe \"lower-middle-class\".  Then how 'bout:\n\n$30-50K annual income is \"middle-class\".  $50-100K is \"upper-middle-class\".\n$100K+ is \"rich\".  $1,000K+ is \"filthy-rich\".  and $10,000+ is \"Bill Gates\".\n\nmake sense? ;^)\n\n-timr\n",

    "context": "There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\nbe rebuilt\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\n\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\n\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\n",

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n",

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).

The one most obviously\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\nspecify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\n\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\nen entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\nbrute-force search for it?\n\nYou use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\none or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \n\nagrep -3 \"qimwe7l\" bigwordandphraselist\n\nfinds that the pattern \"qimwe7l\" is too close to the\npattern \"imsel\" (part of \"himself\" and a host of others),\nto be of any cryptographic value as a key.\n\nAn error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\nletters like \"teh\" for \"the\".  A minimally acceptable password\nwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\nruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\n(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\n*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\n\n\nAnd for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'\ntypos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\nsay I want to find out what people think about Gibson's\nSF book \"Neuromancer\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.\nEven with an error distance specification as small as\nof \"1\" I will find all those people who think the title\nwas \"Necromancer\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\n\nAlso, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\nat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\n\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\ndon't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.\n\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\nthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\nNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\nNational Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\n\nYou can also specify \"fixed\" areas: looking for license\nplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\nyou might say:\n\nagrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\n\nwill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\n(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\nalso \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\nor deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\nfor a particular protein combination, you might know that\nsome kinds of damage cause the \"A\" nucelotide to drop out more\nthan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\n-Dc where you set the \"deletion cost\" to count as \"c\" errors.\n\nA steganographic use (I even used \"agrep -2 \"<steg>eograp\" E\"\njust now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\nintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\nand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\npossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\n\nAlso with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy\nto abstract the \"hits\" into a useful form.  For example,\n\nagrep -d \"^From\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'\n\nsays output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'\nthat contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase',\n'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.\n\nAnd agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster\nthan the second-best similarity tool publicly available.\n\nAs usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs\nto those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do\nan anonymous FTP.\n\nGet this now.\nIt is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.\n\n\nGrady Ward, vendor to the NSA (and proud of it)\n",

    "context": "Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights\nviolations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights\nviolations.\n\nLet's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab\nStates is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can\nclaim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.\n\nI am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of\npeace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.\nI am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to\nit. Peace AND justice. \n\nIf anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present\nhis claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully \nentitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has\na merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they\nwish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the\nPalestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since\nIsrael was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations\nquasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a\nlegitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. \n\nHuman rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor\nare the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.\nIsraeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be\nimplemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. \n\nIsraeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first\nparty has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and\nthe second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some\nsymmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise\nthe necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people\nand as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own\npast towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to\nacknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal\nof most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.\n\nWhen I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages\ndestroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. \nI hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the\nmeaning of such massive destruction and destitution.",

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  \nintends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  \nChrist is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  \nserve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  \nthe bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have  \nalready died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.\n  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  \nthere is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  \ntolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  \nlive with him on the wrong in your life. \n  Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  \nChristian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  \npenalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  \npunishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  \npunishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  \n3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  \nthrough him it might be saved.\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  \nwith painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  \nagainst me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  \nthey are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  \ndis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  \nfater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.\n  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  \nolone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  \ni can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  \nHell? that step is much more rewarding.\n\nstan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu\nmy opinions are my own, you may borrow them",

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be\nwhat I am doing while reading this group.\n\nIts a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\nthanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is\nbetter standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to\ncompletely get rid of IDE.\n--\n  Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.\n  Palm Bay, FL.

He'll be throwing out \nthe first pitch.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not \nAmtrack.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's \ngoing from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to \nbreak the logjam with  ??? Senate?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are \ndiscussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, \nand I think that the President is going to continue to make the point \nthat he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs \nto be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for \nsummer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the \nimportant programs that will put people back to work right away this \nsummer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be \npassed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he compromise, that's the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions \nare going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and \nSenator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President \nbelieves his jobs program should go forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 \nbillion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise \nbeing offered by --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being \noffered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right \nnow, let's see what happens today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would he go that far -- no matter what the \nRepublicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per \nyear?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be \nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \ncome up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's \nsee what happens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has \nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \nto get a vote?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \nintrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in \ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \nPresident's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no \nquestion about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative \nactivity over the last few days.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the \nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     prepared to compromise --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen \nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \nwith Senator Dole. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's \nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \ntime, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by \n$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for \nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong \npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \nand hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that \nhe is not succeeding overall.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He can't beat this, can he?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The fact is they can do that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \naction.  There's no question about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What are you going to do about it?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \nwhen they say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete \nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's \nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the \nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \nthere appears to be --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the \nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \nview.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that \nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \nbut I'm not positive.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that \nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \nI don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \nobservation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President \nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \nI'm not sure exactly how many.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're \nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \nhear that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \nfor the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \nSaddam can't stay in office?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \ncontinue to demand it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \ndominant power in the area --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \nsupport of terrorism.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \nbase that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \narmaments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \nwould be out of power?\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \ndo you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \ndifference with you that's in good faith?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n-\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \nhave an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \nimportant, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \nand to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \nthe summer?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \nRepublicans into your camp?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to \nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \nPresident's intiatives?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \ncould get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \nPresident's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \nhave handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \nexperience?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \nthere's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They're being denied any other legislative means of \nputting their proposals forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any ideas.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \ndefeated; I don't know that they're being denied.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     to present them.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean \nthey get the votes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \nparliamentary rules under which they're playing.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \nsupport all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for \nIraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about \nanything recently.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \nPresident's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \nAngeles.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \nwouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to \nwatch it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \nReverend Jackson while he's out there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see \nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \nraised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, \neven though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \ngame?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe \nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \ninformational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to \nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \nPresident read it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \nPresident Gore.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \nyes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \nactivities?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would \nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \noperation at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the \nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \nnot pursuing some kind of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \nmention in the news conference yesterday --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what \ndoes the U.S. do next?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \nallies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways \nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \nagreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \nsaid there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any \ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \ndifferent.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the \nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to \ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \nthat is under consideration.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's \ncondition, how he's doing?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think \nwe'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \nafter the Mubarak visit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with \nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \nnext several weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \nof the one announced Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the \nmagnitude.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \ndo you stand on that --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \nhe's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this \nweek and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a \nhard look at it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White \nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the \ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll \nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a \nprobability than a possibility?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under \ndiscussion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter \nof time and -- for months before that happens.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's \nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working \nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll \ncontinue to review other matters.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \nthis week?  Any travel?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \ndon't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \nWe'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \ndiscussions.\n\t     \n\t     Thanks.\n",

(Though I am now\nunsure what that sentence does mean.)\n\n\nYou implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to\nhelp the \"butchers of their choice\".  Since the primary targets of help are\nMuslim victims of \"ethnic cleansing\", you imply that such Muslim victims are\nbutchers.\n\n\nThis implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or\nimpossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that\nvictims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities\non the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?\n\n\nYes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not\nbe \"ethnic cleansed\".  The Serbians want to \"ethnic cleanse\" the Muslims.  It\nis indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the\nthings that the two sides want are not equivalent.\n\n\nI recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying\nthat the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to\nSomalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider\nunworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to\nthe opposite place than that predicted by the theory.\n\nFor that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to\nhelp the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If\nthe desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are\nless like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?\nEspecially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?\n--\n\"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude\npicture:\n\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n |\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\n\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\ntime-consuming.\n\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\nof a button, you can change this:\n\n    +---------+\n    + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\nto this:\n\n                   +---------+\n                   + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\n ===============\n\nOkay.

    "context": "\n\nVery sensible.\n\n\n\n\nMust you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in \ndisgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am\nreally sorry if that fact bothers you.\n\n\n\nMore ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.\n\n\nThen what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?\n\n\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere's what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\" plug cables.

The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.

My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.

(They do account for a somewhat larger\nportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)\n\nSome facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of\ntotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of \nphysicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged\npaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  \nMalpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;\nthey've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health\ncare costs have increased more than any period in history.\n\nAs far as \"defensive medicine\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its\ntotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total\ncurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group\nthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine\non health care.\n\nAs small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,\nClinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification\nof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their\nspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits\nwhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.\n\njsh",
