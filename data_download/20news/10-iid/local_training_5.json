Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,\nbecause I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.\n\tBasically, there are a number of functions with prototypes\nset up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite\nwidget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :\n\n\ttypedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)\n\nbut in several places in the HP source code, they reference the\ninsert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just\none, as the prototype suggests.  For example:\n\n\t(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)\n\nNow, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments\nare passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to\nhow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the\ncode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,\nor has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.\n\tMany thanks in advance for any help.\n",

In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of\napprox. 884 billion dollars.\n\n       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In\n192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.\nThat leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted\nfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)\n\n       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,\nHousing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)\ncost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or\nmore than national defense started.  (This represented an increase\nof 230%)\n\n       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on\nMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of\n368%)\n\n       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing\ncredits and subsidies of that like.

If the current government was pushed by\nthe President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to\nequalize once the pressure is gone?\n\n\n       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want\nto continue. I see very little positive about it.\n\n\n       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic\nprocess, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting\nwhat they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the\nbrakes on the \"democratic process\" an inherently bad thing.

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\n\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case\nit isn't a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\n\n* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you've lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm\nmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec's \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I've seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn't.\n\n",

    "context": "\nTrue.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\nseemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\n\n\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\n\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\nI apologize.\n\n\nI have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb\nshould have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\n\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\n\n\nI don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \n\n[...]\n\n\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't\ncare, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil \ninterests, caused us to take action.\n\n\n[...]\n\nI'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\n\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\nwould lead their nation to.\n\n\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\nbut that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nProbably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\nsome other places.\n\nTell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\nI agree that it is deplorable.\n\n\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\nis in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\nthe system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial \nprejudice thrown around.\n\n\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\n\n\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn't mean \"those who do the same thing\",\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\nposition to understand the defendent's motivation(s).\n\n\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\n\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\n\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don't accept (without *far*\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\n\n\nHardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\nand suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\n\nBut don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\ndon't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\n\n\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\n\n\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\n\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the\nsame claim.\n\n\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,",

    "context": "\n\nI will answer this as I find time.\n\n\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.   ",

The Negev Bedouin Before and After 1948 II.     Jewish\nAgricultural Settlement in the Negev III.   Development of the\nNegev's Rural Population IV.    Economic Situation of Jewish\nSettlements in 1990 V.     Failure in Settling the Arava Valley\nVI.   Failure in Settling the Central Mountains VII.  Failure in\nMaking the Negev \"Bedouinenrein\" (Cleansing the Negev of Bedouins)\nVIII. Transforming Bedouin into Low-Paid Workers IX..    Failure\nin Settling the \"Development Towns\" X.      Jordan Water to the\nNegev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping\nGround XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a\nMilitary Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000\n\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It's by our\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\nabandoned desert areas\".\n\nContrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\n\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\npart, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\npastoral activity.\n\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\nbefore and after 1948\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\nand 22,000 goats.\n\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\n\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\nlocal conditions.\n\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\nshepherds from roaming.\n\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\n\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\nfor them.",

Over the last few\nyears I have heard of one case after another of government running\ncompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the\ngovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to\njoin me in collecting and researching information for this project.\n",

    "context": "\nFirst off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \"You sick\nperverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\", which seems to be the\nusual \"religious\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't\nget flamed, either.\n\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\n\n\nSecond, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\noverbearing totalitarianists?\n \n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n\n\t(Evidence deleted)\n\nI'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\na person who shares your beliefs.\n\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\n\n\nHmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?\n                                                      \n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\t\t\t\tnot very objective. \n\n\nOne could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \"more\ngood\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is\nnot necessarily true.\n                     \n                    ^^^^\n      Might I suggest the word \"penis\"? It seems more in line with the tone of\nyour post. \n          \n\nBravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir. \n\n                                                 \nYes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,\nthey are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf\nSternberg, for example.\n\n\nIt serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the\nvirility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the\ncharacter) has orgasmed.                      \n\n\nYour Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your\nchurch.\n         \nIn addition, if sex is for procreation, then\n\n1)\tWhy did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,\nrather than building it in as instinct?\n2)\tWhy did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in\npregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?\n \n \nGranted.\n\n\nPornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for\nit.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real\nlife, but will think about and read about and mull over.\n\nLater,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff                                   \n",

Only\nTV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \"You say that we\nteach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen\nto a child who sees this ?\" And once again he wraps himself in a\nlengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in\nthe field of rubble that was once his home. The term\n'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of\nwhat he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a\nhouse and shreds of belongings.\n\nOnce again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes.

This time they hit the largest number of\nhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely\ndemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more\nbrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the\nresidents were still told to remove their valuables from their\nhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the\nhandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied\nwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to\nstand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were\neven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just\ngold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,\nsome 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind\ntheir backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants\non their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their\nhearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their\nhomes, one after the other.\n\n(...)",

Surely you can\nsee where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?\n\n\n\tPrecisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have\nbeen lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs\nthan trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of\na device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.",

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain.

    "context": "-*----\n\nI think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.\nAbove, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great\nscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre\nscience that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\npresence of qi.\n\n\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. ",

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: \"Bristol Papers\", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n\"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village.\"\n\n\nSources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin \nDucar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918). \nThe French version: \"Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens\nsur la Population Musulmane,\" (Istanbul, 1919).

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n\t\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n\t\t\t    Resulting in Death\n\t\t\t    \n\tWeapon\t\t\t\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------\n\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\t\t 2.4\n\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\t\t12.2\n\n\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n\t\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and\nstarted to experience these problems.\n\nApple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of\npotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware\n(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power\nmanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.\n\nNone of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe\n(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I\nhave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears\nto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on\nstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is\nbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any\nnon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be\nreset by \"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\" -\nApple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button\nI'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if\nsomeone can decipher Apple's advice for me.\n\nBeyond this Apple suggest that \" you should follow the technical\nprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo\".

The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have\nlegitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that\nthey did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the\nvalues system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of\nthese kids.\n\nDespite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are\nsuppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that\ndesired.  \n\nQuestion for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't\nwe teach \"safe drug use\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it\nbecause we know that a class in \"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to\nuse drugs\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \"drug abstinence education\"\nbarred from schools because it teaches \"religion\"?  Aren't we abandoning\nthose children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe\nuse?\n\n",

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

It is the\n   >same thing as \"alien\". Look it up. Remember that the common usage of\n   >the words ARE NOT always their legal meaning.\n\n   This I gotta see some authority for.\n\nfrom Black's Law Dictionary, Revised 4th Ed., page 1473:\n\nRESIDENCE.  A factual place of abode.  Living in a particular\nlocality.  Reese v. Reese, 179 Misc. 665, 40 N.Y.S.2d 468, 472;\nZimmerman, 175 Or. 585, 155 P.2d 293, 295.  It requires only bodily\npresence as an inhabitant of a place.  In re Campbell's Guardianship,\n216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.\n\n     As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place,\nthey are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are\nnot identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as\nin the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means\nliving in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that\nlocality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence\nsimply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place,\nwhile domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an\nintention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S.\n209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties\nthan ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite\nperiod if intent to return remains.  Immigration Act 1917, sec. 3, 8\nU.S.C.A. sec. 136 (e, p).  Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting,\nC.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d 732, 733.  But see, Ward v.

Craig, 182 Okl.\n610, 80 P 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are\nsynonymous terms.  ``Residence'' has a meaning dependent on context\nand purpose of statute.  In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282.\nWords ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable\nmeaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  Kemp v.\nKemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172 Misc. 738.\n\n     Legal residence.  See Legal.\n\nRESIDENT.  One who has his residence in a place.  See Residence.\n\n     Also a tenant, who was obliged to reside on his lord's land, and\nnot to depart from the same; called, also, ``homme levant et\ncouchant,'' and in Normandy, ``resseant du fief.''\n",

I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n",

I'd\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n",

In this case, the establishment of the\nstate does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used\nin order to push for the establishment of the state.\n\nDeciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.\n\n-leo\n",

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\nWe have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-\ntion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n-- ",

Patients are generally kept on steroids for\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\nis worth.  \n\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.

    "context": "\n\nThe village I described was actually the closest I could come to\ndescribing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian\npopulation has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and\nthus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining \ninhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.\nBut for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like\nmine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are\noften inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some\nhave members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others\nare not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is\nnot fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla\ntyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with\nthe local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that\nuse women and children as shields, but because that is the only\nway one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.\n\n\nHizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though\nHizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance\noperation and better motivated by religious conviction.\n\n  As to retaliation,\n\nIt may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses\nits targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on\nsorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the \nattackers came from that specific village but has no further\nintelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against \ncivilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show\nthat it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.\nMost of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and\nindiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.\nI have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,\nthis is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than \nIsraeli troops.\n\n\nI hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still\ncontend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's\nsecurity, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim\nthat the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any \nfurther attacks on Northern Israel.\n \n\n\nHmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better.\nI think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would\nbe willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for\nIsraeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be\ninvolved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the\nnegotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants\nto get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities\nalong the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations\nback in question.\n\n\n\n\nI agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable.\n",

    "context": "Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\n\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.  Detroit Tigers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker\nWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.\n  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.\n  This year could be *very* ugly.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.\nObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.\n\nOne more division to go....\n-- \nDale J.

    "context": "I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         /|   /      |\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.\n1 G   /                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can't tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n",

    "context": "for SRC\n\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \"Passover.\" In English,\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\norigin of this term.\n\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\nFestival.\"\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.

Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n",

Never let them give their\nadvice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow\nthem freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's\nwealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.\n  We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own\ndevices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal\ndesires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great\nanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most\ncorrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any\ncharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to\nmiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they\nwho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend\nto refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.\nLet us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.\nAnd preserve us in any case from their good ones.\"\n\n(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, \np. 118).\n\nI wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)\nviewpoint though.

    "context": "If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against\nusing other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous\nclass of crime is created.\n\nCriminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically\nthe terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)\nwill be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and\nto kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the\ndevice will be delayed.\n\nOnce a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate\nwith impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from\nkey escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.\n\nBecause life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal\nvery large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume\nthat they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous\nproperty (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with\n\"blue box\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,\nwe can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for\nstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes\ncriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen\ninstruments.\n\nBecause a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,\na stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a\ncontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.\n\nIn other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a\ncurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and\npersistent threat to the general public.\n\nOn the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a\ndevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least\nstand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.\n\nFinally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in\nrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,\nthere will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications\nin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,\nand the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and\narchiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible\nacross the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these\nrecordings could open up vast potential for abuse.",

It\nwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.\nThe idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to\nten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main\nspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\nmomentum to the ship.\n\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\nproducts).\n\n  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\nto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\nthey're there.\n\n  I must be missing something.

    "context": "\nAn excellent idea.\n\n\nWhile I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, \nfrom what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for \nstrong cryptography through a distinct organization.\n\nThe EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex\nand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin\nalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one\nstep removed from the old \"crypto-wielding child molester\" argument.  An\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\n\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In\nlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it\nstands to be labelled as \"communist\", \"anarchist hackers\", radical, etc.  \n\nI don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social\nResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical\nantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political\nbaggage.\n\nPerhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography\nwould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing\ngroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to\nadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's\nquestion: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going\nto do about it?\n\nHaving mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,\nI would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:\ngathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the\nissue as well as the First-Amendment side.\n\n",

Congrats! \n\n\n  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you\nconverted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the\ndifference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for\na laserdisc company or something). \n\n\n  Hey, no fair! What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically\nhas to pivot the bat around along with his body. \n\n\n  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at \nthe plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level\nplane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could\nhit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes\ncontact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he\ncaught not ready for a pitch. \n\n  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to\npractice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) \n\n  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front\nfoot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but\nI keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot\nout of his hips. \n\n\n  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. \n\n  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean\nPalmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. \n\n\n  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.\nIMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling\noff the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders\nlow and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left \nand left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to \nthe right side of the infield in the next month. \n",

Four or five\n#>cars were hit.  There were several serious injuries, and sadly\n#>a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck \n#>in the head by one of the larger rocks.  I don't recall if she \n#>made it, but I think she was comatose for a month or so and \n#>doctors weren't holding out hope that she'd live.\n#>\n#>What the hell is happening to this great country of ours?  I\n#>can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such, but\n#>20 pound rocks??!  Has our society really stooped this low??\n\n   Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught, there is no punishment\n at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping\n with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand\n what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen\n any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching\n him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would\n inevitably wind up dead early anyway.\n\n   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,\n he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-\n gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment\n industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our\n modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that\n we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.\n\n#>\n#>Erik velapold\n# \n#Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason\n#is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is\n#\"No Big Deal\". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort \n#children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised\n#when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the\n#message they hear is \"Life is Cheap\"!\n\n  And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much \n about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is\n the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!\n And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to\n whatever violent hate-promoting \"music\" and videos they like because no\n one is home to stop it.\n\n  This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn\n than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is\n shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in\n school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when\n they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There\n is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will\n bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com\n-\n   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling\nhimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first\nin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term\nbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is\nsynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\nnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim\nto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-\nshipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\n\n  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In\nsearch of the Indo-Europeans\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nThe reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature\nas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and\nfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible\nthings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have\nno clear claim.",

The 27th was a short day at\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and \nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to \n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\n\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, \nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\naround it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\ndidn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\n\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \nthings, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.\n\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. \nI didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\no'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \ndemonstration and move slowly.\n\nMy wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \nand went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 \nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\n\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\nuneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\" \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n\nNo.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  \n\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \nnaturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\n\n\n\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  Well, I am\nsure there are plenty of \"scientific\" creationist \"rebuttals\" out there \nsomewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.\n\n[just for the record, again, AMH = anatomically modern humans] \n\nBest regards :-),",

Biomedical research doesn't make any basic \nassumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".  Psychology\nalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. \n\n\nOversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-\ntion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually \nfound wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will \nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \nThere's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\nscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  ",

    "context": "Tony-\n\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\npeople's expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n\nWhatever",

You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX\t\tobfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.\nX       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for\nX       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.\nX\nX    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry\nX       must be sent in a separate Email letter.\nX\nX   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  \nX       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.\nX\nX   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,\nX       special owner or group) are not allowed.\nX    \nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

The first part of the plan is to begin a \ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \nposed by new technology.\n\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \nagents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \ncommunications products.\n\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \nbased on open standards.\n\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \nindividual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \ninquiries?  \n\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \nthe discussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \nyet.\n\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \nusing it.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \nwhich the government or others could break the code without \nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \nof the investigation would then be made public.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\nDaniel J.

In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\n\n\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\n\n\nThe Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\n\nYou write:\n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.

Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.

I get the feeling that the original poster\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\ncertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\nway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\ndifficult to respond to.

I do\nnot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions\nfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities.

And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\nFaith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \nof evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith.

Similarly\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\ngovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights and\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\n\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there.

Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\n\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\nto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the\nPalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\n\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\nseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come to\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\n'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\nquo>.\n\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\nits burden. [.....].\n\n\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\nthus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".",

    "context": "\n\nAs usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The\nproposal clearly states:\n\n=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nIt speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.\nMaybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.\n\n\nThat's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to\nthink. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost\nanybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean\nsecure) encryption is used. What will happen when (\"if\"? Ha!\noptimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT\nSOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of\nthese \"some\" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes\non the former (\"almost nobody\") - which is clearly an improvement -\nand \"forgets\" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (\"guaranteed\").\nYes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the\nstrong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.\n\n\nIt's not just \"continued ability\". It's -guaranteed- ability.\n\n\nYeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's\ntake small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't\nthink about the future. Trust us.\n\n\nIt's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the\nintention. They, unlike you, read what they write.\n\n\nYes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will\nallow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,\nof course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the\njerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The\nnew proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,\nthat will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that\nmentally pervert...\n\n\nGreat. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)\nhas succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any\ndetails whatsoever and has concluded that it is \"highly secure\". I\nguess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the\ntwo major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government\ncan save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto\nexperts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David\nSternlight has already done all the job for them...\n\n\n\"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.\"\n\n\n\"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of\nfuture safety, do not deserve either.\" This (or something like that; I\ndon't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said\nby one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more\ncarefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.\n\n\nThe main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure\ncryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying \"we\nguarantee that every American will still have the full right to use\nany kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as\njust a default, voluntary implementation\", there would have been much\nless opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise\nyou that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?\n\n\nNo, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.\n\n\nWhile the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is\nnot done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily\nbreakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable\nby somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who\nhas only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't\nyou simply trust them, huh?\n\n\nIt is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It\nmight be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a\nwild speculation.\n\n\nThe trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.\n\n\nLegitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I\nguess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys?\nIt's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide\nwho has the right to use it \"legitimately\"...\n\n\nImpossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence\nand ignorance as in the provious threads.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent\nmessage.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin",

    "context": "\n\n\n\n    Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who\ndie young, etc. ?\n\n\n\n\n   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is\nsomething akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.\n\n\n\n   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond \nbodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe\nthey're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand\nthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\nthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want\nto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,\nbut this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die\na final death))\n\n   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \n(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll\nnever know I'm dead. Hmmm... \n\n\n\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\" ?\n\n    Consider the following statement:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\"\n\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \nGranted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any\nconscious experience whatsoever). \n\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \nimmortality). \n\n\n\n\n   Pax,",

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand\non two of her comments.\n\n\nOne of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning\nabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,\nscope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of\nevidence that are marshalled for a claim.

A \"carefully\ndesigned and controlled study\" is neither always possible nor\nalways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a\nremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we\nhave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind\nof claim to ask for a \"carefully designed and controlled study\"\nto alleviate our skepticism.)\n\nRules such as \"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and\ncontrolled study\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.\nI think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be\nconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have\noccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.

    "context": "Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to\tshow  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\tIgna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\t\"Then\n    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\tpray:\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\tcarrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\tto  the  Lord\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\n\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\n\n    - Brendan Arthur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\n\nGod Bless\n\nFrom Simon\nLines:  106",

My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.",

Any thinking approach\nto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it\nthat women and men are spiritual equals.\n\nI think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have\nsouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be\nforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the\nafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the\npart saying \"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\"\nsays they have souls.  \n\n(If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then \nI have no idea _what_ a soul is.)\n\nAs for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority\nin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give\nall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to\nMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,\ndenying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be\nconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.\n\n\nLook, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and\nthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\nQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\nsince women can clearly be \"forgiven\" and \"rewarded\" they _must_ have\nsouls (from the above verse).\n\nLet's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \nfully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.",

    "context": "\n\nThe theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi \nArmenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. \nNow, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.\n\nWhat is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been\nefforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a\none-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\n\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \n\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \n\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\n\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"[2]\n \nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the \nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]\n\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\ncruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,\nbut also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]\n\n[1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari\n    Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918).

Compare the Northern\n#  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference \n#  in the capital to labor intensity.\n\nCapital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that\ncapital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.\n\nSlavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not\nin 1850.\n\n# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's -\n# #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the \n# #South.  \n# \n# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because\n#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without\n#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have \n#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come \n#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,\n#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and\n#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing \n#  agriculturalists.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_\n#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.\n\nThis assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments\nwould not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the\nNorth.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else\nto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt\nthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive\nthreat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the\nmaintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local\ngovernments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside\ncapital investment in the Southern states.\n\n# \tCraig A.

In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\n\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \n\"rebels\".\n\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\n\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \nArmenians were a \"threat\".\n\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\n\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish\npopulation.\n\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\n\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\n\n",

    "context": "Los Angeles Times, Tuesday, April 13, 1993.  P. A1.\n\nNEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE\n\n\t* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage\n\t  by a man who infiltrated political groups\n\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time\nart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In\nreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and\namassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40\nyears.\n\nHis code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was\nso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen\nto head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.\n\nFor a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White\nAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he\nobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. \nAnd he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government\nto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.\n\nThese are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former\nLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with\npolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide\nintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nOfficials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper\nactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They\nhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.\n\nTranscripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents\nreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details\nof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line\ninto illegal territory.\n\nAt times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air\nwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with\nforeign agents and code names like \"Ironsides\" and \"Flipper.\"\n\nOn one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a\npro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,\nIsrael.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties\nto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. \nShortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed\nhim.\n\nThe court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA\nagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing\nconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nGerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by\nthe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its\ncontents included passports, driver's licenses and identification\ncards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for\nfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank\nbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from\nvarious agencies.\n\nAlso in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a\nblack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of\nblindfolded and chained men.\n\nInvestigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the\nADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information\non a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one\ntarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nEach case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would\nconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in\nan affidavit for a search warrant.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil\nrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on\ngroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's\nfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a\nreputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with\npolice agencies and journalists. \n\nHowever, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files\non at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United\nFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for\nInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the\nAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.\n\nThe computer files also included information on several members of\nCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman\nRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey\nfrom the Bay Area.\n\nIn their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation\nLeague has collected information on political activists in the Los\nAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely\nwith three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in\nintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism\nexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence\nofficer.\n\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew\nnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los\nAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the\ninvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined\ncomment.\n\nBullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy\ndrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a\nvolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a\nbook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.\n\nBullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by\nthe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the\nmid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations\nup and down the West Coast.\n\nTo keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled\nthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never\nmissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.\n\n\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all\nanti-democratic movements,\" Bullock said.  \". . . Officially, I'm only\na contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not\nbe officially connected with me.\"\n\nBullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists\nto Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own\nname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.\n\n\"I'm one of a kind,\" he told police.\n\nIn recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become\nknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a\nshotgun who threatened to kill him.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a\nsynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and\nmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by\npolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became close\nfriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco\npolice intelligence division.\n\nBullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An\nFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:\n\n\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and\nwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to\nGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to\nBullock.\"\n\nFrom a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876\nindividuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files\ncontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.\n\nIn 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of\ninformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells of\nmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels\nand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100\nbills.\n\nBullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled\nonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published\nby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African\nBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --\nand submitted it as his own work.\n\nBullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. \nBullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government\nevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \"I may be gay but I'm a\nstraight arrow.\"\n\nIn his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about\nengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to\nviolate the law.\n\nFor example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records\nand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of\nthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said\nGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence\nfiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under\ndepartment policy.\n\nBullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation\nof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San\nFrancisco office.\n\nBullock seemed proud of his \"Operation Eavesdrop,\" in which he used a\npaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan\nResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by\nmembers of the right-wing group.  \"For a short time, it was\nwonderful,\" he told police.\n\nIn Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago\nas a \"fact-finder\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go\nundercover to the meetings of target groups.\n\nAmong other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles\nADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \"anti-Israel\nleanings\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such\nsentiment.\n\nGurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he\nattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a\nrival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for\nHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival\nand threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate\ngroup.\n\nGurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the\nprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. \nUnlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the\ninvestigation.\n\nGurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed\nby The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.",

If the NSA comes up with\nthe numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.\n\n\nMe either.\n\n   It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to\nquestion this bogosity:\n\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\nApril 16, 1993\nWashington, DC\n\n               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC\n           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE\n\n        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)\ntoday called for the public disclosure of technical data\nunderlying the government's newly-announced \"Public Encryption\nManagement\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\n\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of\nsuch standards.\n\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\nDSS.\n\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\nadministration's apparent commitment to the privacy of\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today's official\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\nthe propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\nplay a leading role in the development process.\"\n\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\ntechnology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and\nmaintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts and Washington, DC.

Since they aren't fixed in position on their\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\n\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\nhelp.\n\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller.

    "context": "\n\nBut why do you characterize this as a \"flight of fancy\" or a \"fantasy\"?\nWhile I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious\nthat his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was\nat least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance\nof current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that\nsomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation\ninto that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This\ndoes not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of\nfancy or a fantasy.\n\n\nWell, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,\n\"extra-scientific\", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of\nrationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble\nover what a \"surprising\" experiment is, what counts as \"surprising\", etc.\nThe same may be said about \"logical grounds\".  My point is that quite frequently\n(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to\npreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of\nsome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \"sea of air\"\nhypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \"surprising\"?\nWell, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must\nbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of \"perfectly rational grounds\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \"new\"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.",

    "context": "I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of \"arrogance of\nChristians\" and look forward to any responses.  In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.",

Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\n\"throne\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\n\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. \nIt's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.

    "context": "I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don't worry \nbecause we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n",

    "context": "seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks:\n > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?\n \n       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. \nEaster (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan\nwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \"what is\nthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\"  When phrased\nthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately\napparent what my objection to \"celebrating\" her would be.\n \n > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\n \n      No, you are thinking perhaps of \"Ressurection Sunday\" I think. \n(Though I'm not too crazy about the word \"Sunday\", but I certainly like\nthis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)\n     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\nFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\nmethods?\n \n > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\n \n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\ngoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\nwhore out of the discussion.\n \n > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if\n > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of\n > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some\n > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be\n > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated\n > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.\n \n       Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave\nstreets with \"Afro-Canadiantop\".  <grin> (I still think \"blacktop\" sounds\nbetter though.)\n \n > As a short person, I hope they will also remove the definition\n > \"curt or surly\" associated with my physical description.)\n \n       Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are\nboth \"sinister\" and \"gauche\" so we probably will have some objections from\nthat quarter as well.\n \n > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the\n > resurrection is \"Pa^ques\"--this is etymologically related\n > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the\n > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better\n > because it uses the right name?\n \n      Yes, that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there would\nthinks that phrasing sounds worse?\n \n > So from this I infer that there are different rules for\n > Christians of Jewish descent?  What happened to \"there is\n > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for\n > all are one in Christ Jesus\"?\n \n      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \"slave\"\nreturned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon\nPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \"rules\" that\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \"male and female\" can Adam\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\ndifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in\nMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.\n \n---------------------------------------\n\n[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it\nseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is\nnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.\n\nI'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this\nargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of\nthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some\nChristians prefer to refer to \"first day\", \"second day\", etc.  However\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question\nseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows\nas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when\nthey use it is different.\n\nIndeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be\ndangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\ncelebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that\nthis is a healthy thing.",

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...",

    "context": "There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn",

EDT\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's \nprotest today?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  \nI think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, \nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \nthat and get cloture?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \npressure not to do it.  \n\t     \n\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \nAmericans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.",

    "context": ": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\n\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\n\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\n\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\nperforming works.\n\n``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy\nhe saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy\nSpirit.''

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n",

    "context": "[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)]\n \n \n \n \nFrom A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:\n \n\"Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would\nremain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For\ninstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion\nis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have\npreferences regarding human activity.\"",

From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)",

If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say\nscam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have\nto go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For\nthe California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative\nbodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.

    "context": "The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option\nin the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats\na Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while\nthe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \"Tek-term\") is\nactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus\nto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the \nTek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of\nXterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  \n\nThe xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.\n\nSubsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics \nhighlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move \nthe Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve \nscreen space, it stays an icon.\n\n\nThe desired behavior: one of two options - \n\n    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the \n       inactive one.\n\n    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon\n       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher \n       level than the Xterm.\n\nWhat I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will\nbe at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.\nThese commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the \ncommand that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.\n\nOther information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb \nX-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.\n\nThanks for your time.

    "context": "\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment.\"\n\t- T. Jefferson.\n\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\n\n\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\n\n\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n\t48700 deaths by auto\n\t11300 deaths by fall\n\t 5300 deaths by drowning\n\t 4800 deaths by fire\n\t 4400 deaths by poison\n\t 3200 deaths by food\n\t 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

At the rate \nof the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.\n\nCONCLUSION\n==========\nFirearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over \nsixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.\n\n\n\n[1] = Year.\n[2] = Population.\n[3] = Accidental deaths.\n[4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.\n\n\n[1]   [2]          [3]    [4]       [1]   [2]          [3]    [4]   \n1932  124,840,000  3,000  24.03     1961  183,691,000  2,204  12.00\n1933  125,579,000  3,014  24.00     1962  186,538,000  2,092  11.21     \n1934  126,374,000  3,033  24.00     1963  189,242,000  2,263  11.96     \n1935  127,250,000  2,799  22.00     1964  191,889,000  2,275  11.86     \n1936  128,053,000  2,817  22.00     1965  194,303,000  2,344  12.06     \n1937  128,825,000  2,576  20.00     1966  196,560,000  2,558  13.01     \n1938  129,825,000  2,726  21.00     1967  198,712,000  2,896  14.57     \n1939  130,880,000  2,618  20.00     1968  200,706,000  2,394  11.93     \n1940  132,122,000  2,375  17.98     1969  202,677,000  2,309  11.39     \n1941  133,402,000  2,396  17.96     1970  204,879,000  2,406  11.74     \n1942  134,860,000  2,678  19.86     1971  207,661,000  2,360  11.36     \n1943  136,739,000  2,282  16.69     1972  209,896,000  2,442  11.63    \n1944  138,397,000  2,392  17.28     1973  211,909,000  2,618  12.35    \n1945  139,928,000  2,385  17.04     1974  213,854,000  2,613  12.22    \n1946  141,389,000  2,801  19.81     1975  215,854,000  2,380  11.03    \n1947  144,126,000  2,439  16.92     1976  218,035,000  2,059   9.44    \n1948  146,631,000  2,191  14.94     1977  220,239,000  1,982   9.00    \n1949  149,188,000  2,330  15.62     1978  222,585,000  1,806   8.11    \n1950  151,684,000  2,174  14.33     1979  225,055,000  2,004   8.90\n1951  154,287,000  2,247  14.56     1980  227,757,000  1,955   8.58    \n1952  156,954,000  2,210  14.08     1981  230,138,000  1,871   8.13\n1953  159,565,000  2,277  14.27     1982  232,520,000  1,756   7.55    \n1954  162,391,000  2,271  13.98     1983  234,799,000  1,695   7.22    \n1955  165,275,000  2,120  12.83     1984  237,001,000  1,668   7.04    \n1956  168,221,000  2,202  13.09     1985  239,279,000  1,649   6.89    \n1957  171,274,000  2,369  13.83     1986  241,613,000  1,600   6.62    \n1958  174,141,000  2,172  12.47     1987  243,915,000  1,400   5.74    \n1959  177,073,000  2,258  12.75           \n1960  180,671,000  2,334  12.92\n\nSources: \nU.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, \nColonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition, Part 2, Washington, DC, 1975.\n\nU.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: \n1982-83.

    "context": "LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\nyounger.\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?",

You\ncan design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete\ncopy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard\nto copy at once may actually make sense.

They \nwould rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how\nsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They \nsupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum\nwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society\nor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun\ncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun\ncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres\nand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault\nof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify\nit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their\nambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in\nthe New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that\ncarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable\nfact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted\nway, with inevitable consequences.\n\nThe Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and\nthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of\nrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have\ndeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message\naround and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.\nThis is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.\n\nOne of the problems is that you look at the world through\nthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find\nmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated by\npeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying\nthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely\npointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.\n\nConsider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\nlive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\n(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\nsubjects.\n\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\npower, greed and hatred.

A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from\n: phobia = an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe (not only in ACT UP meetings,\n: the word is apparently in general use now.  Or perhaps it isn't in the bible?  \n: Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak?)\n: \n: Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider?  Does an\n: agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  Do you\n: understand English?\n: \n: Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best\n: to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or\n: run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  People\n: who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or\n: cause them (or themselves) violence.\n: \n\nIsn't that what I said ...\nWhat are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely\nparenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.\n\n: [...]\n: \n: |> It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function\n: |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs\n: |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to\n: |> subsequent generations.

Obviously you keep to the\n: Monty Python song:  \"Every sperm is sacred\".  And if, as *you* say, it has\n: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own \n: arguement, natural.\n\nConsider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One\nof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a\nspecies procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.\n\n: \n: |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to\n: |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must\n: |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a\n: |> family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family,\n: |> homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you\n: |> will.\n: |> \n: \n: Well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have \n: vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  Also the parent from single\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\n: by your arguement, die.\n\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\n: \n: |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually\n: |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social\n: |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative\n: |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in\n: |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there's\n: |> more.\n: |> \n: \n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\n: These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have \n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's \n: another arguement...) so it's more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\n\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\nhomosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\n\n: \n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

Who are you to tell anyone else how to live\n: their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?\n\nHere's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\n: \n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\n: |> the homosexual \"life-style\". But since the charge is only intended to\n: |> intimidate, it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken\n: |> seriously. Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for\n: |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.\n: |> \n: \n: Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the\n: bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by\n: a \"bastard\" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either\n: accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.\n\nI'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it\nso well I can't see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated or\notherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything\nat all to contribute?\n\n: \n: |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in\n: |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from\n: |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and\n: |> biological.

I'am arguing about \n: the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?\n\n\nIt could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \n\n\nCome again?\n\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

The remaining people,\n were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the \n withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown \n into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens\n ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls\n and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.\n The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than\n those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,\n horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in\n Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had\n has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.\n\n The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in\n stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and \n Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have \n been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely\n massacred.\n\n Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that\n history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions.\"\n\n:  (a long list)\n:  (a long list)\"\n\nAnd still anxiously awaiting...\n\nSerdar Argic",

Their primary function is\nto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the\nplayers from trying to kill each other. \n\nUmpires have to be extremely tough people.

All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \"go ballistic\",\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,\nphysicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,\nas is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked\nthings that the patients should have found out from their physician\nbut didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.\nSometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to\nask the system, we hope.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" ",

If right now, I felt like someone out\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would\nframe a response something like this:\n\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\nopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\nfor him.\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\n\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\n\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\n\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\n\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\nis to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or\nhusband.\n\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\n\nLove,",

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents\n\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n* What is the Enigma?\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n* What is the coding system used by VCR+?\n\n\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\n\n  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.\n  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password\n  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\n  [BER91].\n\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''\n\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\n  following: \n\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\n\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\n\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\n  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in\n  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\n\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n\n  Here's one popular method, using the des command:\n\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\n\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\n  writing.\n\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\n  as well.\n\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\n  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\n  in the USA.\n\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\n  the USA.\n\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\n  we know).\n\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\n  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\n\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\n\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\n\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\n  \n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\n\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\n\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\n  plaintext.\n\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\n  expected to remain valid.\n\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\n\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\n\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\n\n\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\n\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\n  string.\n\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\n\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\n  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.\n\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\n\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\n  intercepted.\n\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\n  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\n  promising directions.\n\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\n\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\n\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\n  handling of keys.\n\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\n\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''\n\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\n  structure at all.\n\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\n\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\n\n  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do\n  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\n  the language as a whole.\n\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.\n  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood\n  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with\n  reasonably robust answers.\n\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\n\n* What is the Enigma?\n\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\n  the British during WWII.''\n\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\n\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\n  addresses given)\n\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\n\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\n  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\n\n\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\n\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\n\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\n  illegal copy.\n\n\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number\n  is (801) 224-6970\n\n  No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the\n  subject....\n\n  Peleg, S. and Rosenfeld, A.  \"Breaking Substitution Ciphers Using a\n  Relaxation Algorithm\" Comm.

However, who is at blame is another question.\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\n\n\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\nof innocents.\n\n\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\n\n\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\n\n\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\n\n\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\nexecution, is it?\n\n\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\ninnocent victim is.\n\n\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\n\n\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\nconviction was unfair.\n\n\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\npossible information), we can't always determine the difference in our\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\nbut it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\n\n\nBut what we know has no effect on an objective system.\n\n\nWhy are you so sure?\n\n\nWhy is *your* reality important?\n\n\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\ntotally ideal and objective system.\n\n\nWell, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.\nWe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to\nthe ideal system as possible.\n\n\nYes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.\n\n\nWe must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep\nseparating the justice system from the pack?\n\n\nI don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an\nobjective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective\nsystem is not possible in practice.",

It is **very** difficult to \"identify\" who they are (this\n*is why* the \"guerillas\" prefer to lose themselves in the general population \nby dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).\nI agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these\nattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its\nsituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control\nthis \"third party state\" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept\noccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do\nsomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?\nIt is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside\nparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola\nhad the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolan\nguerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa\nrefused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,\nwould Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that\nAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?\nI refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from\nLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. \n\nOne hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its \nborder but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS \nCHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the \nLebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it \nEASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That\n**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*\nhave been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. \nI fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be \"used\" by EITHER side,\nand have been (and continue to be).

Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \n\n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.",

Most of the C preprocessors that\n\tI have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n\tline.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n\tstart of a directive. \n\n\tHowever the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n\tas the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n\tthat \"This\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n\timake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n\tfix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n\tuse of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n\tgives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's\nthat behave similarly?",

You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF \ncrooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in \nsuch a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has \nalready been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer \nand hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible \nfor the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering \nTurkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically \ncalls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian \nand criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government \nas merely a step on the road to said genocide. \n\nNow where shall I begin?\n\n#From: ahmet@eecg.toronto.edu (Parlakbilek Ahmet)\n#Subject: YALANCI, LIAR : DAVIDIAN\n#Keywords: Davidian, the biggest liar\n#Message-ID: <1991Jan10.122057.11613@jarvis.csri.toronto.edu>\n\nFollowing is the article that Davidian claims that Hasan Mutlu is a liar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[some parts are deleted]\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t- - -\n\n\n\n\nReceiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,\"Genocide...\" and\nwhat I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book\nwas like \"voice of Armenian revolutionists\" and although I read the whole book,\nI could not find the original quota.\nBut there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found \nthe original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:\n\n\n\n     ======================================================================\n    ======\n\nQUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !\n\nDAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU\nJUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.\n\nDavidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...\n\nYou are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow\nyou can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided\nnot to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise\nall the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least\nwe may save time by not dealing with your lies.\n\nAnd for the following line:\n\nI also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you.\nI hope you will be drowned in your lies.\n\nAhmet PARLAKBILEK\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \"it is\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?

Also, feel \nfree to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,\nthe Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian\ncriminal organizations.\n\nArmenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,\nwomen and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and \nthose like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.\n\nNot a chance.\n\nSerdar Argic",

In that posting\nI made sure I used the word \"public\".  Public revelation contains\nGod's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained\nin the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private\nrevelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak\ndirectly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the\nVirgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to\nbelieve a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.\nDevotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,\nbut doctrines can not.\n\nWhen an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the\nChurch may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood\nthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be\napproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,\nit is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from\nGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most\nwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those\nat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject\nFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not\nmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\n\nI do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in\nevaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need\nevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that\nnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything\nknown through public revelation\n-------\nMarty Helgesen\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu",

One you have\nsupplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the\nfuture (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to\ndecap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating\nhigh-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not \ngoing to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the\nreal me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business\nreasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that\nwe're not the main threat.\n\nI also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon\ncould possibly be called \"classified.\"  It's like handing out military\nsecrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \"don't open me.\"  I can\nimagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to\na trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.\n\n\nAmusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable\nfor a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?\nIn DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you\njust swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect\non the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of\nthat cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that\nit would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search\nalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.\nI have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  \nHowever, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its \ndesigners would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion \nof such techniques seems credible.\n\nHmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name\n\"Clipper\" for this device. :)\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\nGod\".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  \nthought out discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

    "context": "The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\n\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n",

Look in the first chapter\nof that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there\nin chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:\n\n\t\"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,\n\tespecially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently\n\tthe province of individuals who create new inventions and\n\tdiscover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this\n\tbook that there is no wealth creation.\n\n\t\"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,\n\thowever the mathematical modeling of such an inherently\n\tunpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume\n\tno wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical\n\teconomic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid\n\tas it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested.\"\n\nSo the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now\nassuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an\nidea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple\nthings.\n\nTo be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience\nbuilding bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical\nphysicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t- Bill Woody",

    "context": "\n<stuff deleted>\n\n\nGood gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******",

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?",

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

[ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n\t\t   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   \"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! \"\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.

Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display.

If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

The sermon was\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out\nspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,\nbecause of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that\nthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\n\"melting in fear.\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and\nknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt\nuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\n\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\nme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\nshouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \"ethnic cleansing\" in\nBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.\nConsidering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\nwho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\nGod's work?",

The controller card must\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\ndisk to index to information in that file.\n\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must\ngo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating\nsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\n\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space.

I'm sure there are HMOs in\nwhich the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's\nincome.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no\ndirect incentive to under-order.
