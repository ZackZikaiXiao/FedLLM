    "context": "\nhenrik]  My response to the \"shooting down\" of a Turkish airplane over the \nhenrik]  Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the \nhenrik]  person from your Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to \nhenrik]  drag ARMENIA into the KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The \nhenrik]  KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik]  years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are \nhenrik]  the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \nhenrik]  themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY \nhenrik]  for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and \nhenrik]  othe Russian aircraft. \n\nhenrik]  At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \nhenrik]  KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL \nhenrik]  NEVER OCCUR again.\n\nDA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian\nDA] soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.\n\n    Well, this is your opinion ! \n\n    Turkish/ Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE. However, \n    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if \n    KARABAKHI-Armenians had had HEAVY losses.\n\n\nDA] You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression\nDA] only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better\nDA] organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns\nDA] repeatedly.  \n\n\tRead what ? The New York Times , that is publishing anti-armenian\n\tarticles. Nop, I have my resources. Look, everyone knows how aggressive\n        Turks/Azeris have been in the past. Armenians ARE NOT gona sit\n\taround and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS. \n\nDA] It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized, have more success \nDA] militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly.  \n\n\tBuch of non-sence CRAP and you know it. Who the hell you think\n        you are talking to ? Azeris are FIGHTING LOCAL ARMENIANS in \n\tNagarno-Karabakh. You tell me who has more MIG's ? Freedom fighters\n        in Nagarno-Karabakh or Azerbaijan ?\n\n\tAgain, I will say it for the last time, ARMENIA is NOT involved\n        in this WAR and you guys WANT to bring this up in order to cover \n        up the Turkish involvment in the Karabakh. Go ahead , REPEAT as \n\tmuch as you want. \n\nDA] I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to\nDA] intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to\nDA] last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both\nDA] on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed\nDA] for the ongoing standoff in the region.  \n\n\tNot a chance ! You CAN NOT convince me (based on your REASONS)that \n\tyour GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS. \n\nDA] Lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  I vote yes for it.\nDA] After all, it is now free.  ",

If you just don't seem\nto get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities\nthan of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions \nwell.\n\tHaving said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this \nboard to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack\nthe author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the\nability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.\n\nPeace,\n",

It seems that the Leafs\noffense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they\nturn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last\ncouple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.\nI don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,\nDET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.\n\nVAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.\n\nUpset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.\nThere is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.\nWIN in 6.\n\nCAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.\nAnybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does\nnot watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.\nCAL in 4.\n\n\n2nd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. \nIt seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their\nsaving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.\nHowever, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little\ntoo high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,\nI will say PITT in 6.\n\nBOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.\nMON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.\nThe couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the\nB's.  B's in 6.\n\n\nCHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.\nYikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine\nof late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played\nlike killers.  DET in 6.\n\nWIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.\nCAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out\nmuscle WIN.  CAL in 5.\n\n3rd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. \n\nI hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over\nand give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may\nbe something to this - if you think of the rivalry.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's\nand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]",

Comments\n  are invited. - Paul )\n\nIn alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to\nhim, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies\nas escrow agencies.\n\nI am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow\nagencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however,\nthat *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.\n\nAs a private citizen, I would feel much more \"secure in my person and\npapers\" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil\nliberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of\nmy key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure\nby the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or\novertly controlled by the government.\n\nOf those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you\nmentioned, I have the following comments:\n\n\t- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have\n        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not\n        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_\n\tinformation, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's\n      \tlikely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly\n \t*wrongful* disclosure.\n\n\t- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of\n \ttheir fidelity and ability.\n\n\t- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF\n\tto safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a \n\tbetter choice.\n\nEver since last fall's \"trial balloon\" was posted in sci.crypt, your\nname has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in\nthe ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.\n\nI agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always*\nact properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn\nagents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel\nthat having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.\n\n\nRespectfully,\n-Paul Robichaux\n (not speaking for NTI, BCSS, or NASA)\n\n",

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\n\nI've been working at this company for eight years in various\nengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\non seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n\t- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n\t- someone's sick idea of flirting\n\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying \"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\", \"you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his\nloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\nhand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding\non to me.)\n\nAlthough this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\nall, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\ntopics.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you,\nEsther\n",

Jesus is the head of the body, the church\n   B.  You cannot say \"yes\" to Jesus, but \"no\" to the church\n\nEphesians 2:19-22\n   A.  The church is the family of God\n   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only\n          Cornerstone=Christ\n          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament\n                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church\n\nAs for the question of denominations:\n   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians\n4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in\nthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church\n(and in time, their writings)\n   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy\n4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a\nchurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle\n\nHebrews 10:24-25\n   A.  Do not miss church\n   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.\nInvolved on a relationship level in the church\n   C.  Must come to ALL services\n\nAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be\nencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.\n\nOf course, more standards apply:\n   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives\nand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,\ndisciples).\n   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul\n(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly\nface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take\nPaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify\nhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the\npastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of\nother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've\nmade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of\nMatthew 24).",

(A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\n\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \nalternatively.\n\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \nthe media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \nalternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \npack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \ndegaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \nvendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \nremoved in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \ndestruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \nplatters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\n\n7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\"\n\n[see DoD Computer Security Center, \"Department of Defense Magnetic \nRemanence Security Guideline\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \nONLY]\n\n------\n\nThis and many other interesting documents (many that are more \ninformative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \ncan be obtained (free) from:\n\nExecutive Secretary\nNational Telecommunications and Informations\n  Systems Security Committee\nNational Security Agency\nFort George G.

By\nelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,\n51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to\nhave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign\ncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,\nrelied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV\nadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications\nraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.\n \nDespite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison\ninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have\nthe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.\n \n                Downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406)\n                A service of the\n                National Rifle Association\n                Institute for Legislative Action\n                Washington, DC 20036",

    "context": "\nAt issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and\nimprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the\ncase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason\nto believe it still goes on.\n\nRead this:\n\nFrom Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\n\nPUBLICATION BAN\n\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\n        being made public.\n\nBy Baruch Me'iri\n\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\nwhich may legally not be published\".\n\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\n\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\n\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\nCommunist countries.\n\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\n\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\nLegal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\n\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\n\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\n\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\nthe mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\n\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\n\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\n\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\nsuspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\n\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\nhappy...\"\n\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\n\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\n\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the\ndiscretion of the court?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\nthey can misuse.\"\n\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\nmatter being made public.\"\n\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's\narrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \"A healthy\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\n\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\n\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\n\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\nthe most extreme circumstances.\"",

The dealer\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.

All types of software may be submitted for\nentry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.\n\nWSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize\ntheir software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase\ntheir installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software\nwill benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their\nfingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other\nrelevant information.\n\nWindows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all\n   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart\n   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details\n   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,\n   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any\n   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the\n   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the\n   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it\n   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480\n   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.\n   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will\n   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files\n   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting \n   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,\n   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows\n   NotePad to create the .TXT file. \n \n2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which\n   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases\n   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may\n   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit\n   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which\n   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's\n   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or\n   WinGIF. \n\n3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs\n   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be\n   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.\n\n4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  \n\n5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional\n   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).\n\n6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:\n   \n   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU\n\n   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America\n   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP\n   file, then e-mail to:\n\n   DiegoAA\n\n7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete\n   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,\n   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.\n\nAll entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent\nedition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and\nwe reserve the right to make changes to the entries.\n\nWSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be\ndevoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial\nsoftware authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of\nthe limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required\n(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There\nis no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial\nproduct entries.  \n\nAdvertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may\nbe submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of\nthe size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first\nten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent\nsubmissions will not be included due to size constraints.\n\nWSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author\ncolumns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and\ntwo Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will\nbe on a voluntary basis.

Boghosian, \"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity\nMeeting,\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.\n\nATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,\nincluding the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both\nArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the \nArmenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new\nArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during\nthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\n\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\nof ASALA...\n\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued \nsupport of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\n\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\n\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\n\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\n\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\n\nNow any comment?\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \"it is\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?  \n \n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \n \n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \n \n Any question?\n \nSerdar Argic",

Sec 552, which was intended to prevent \"secret lawmaking\" by\nadministrative bodies.\n   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-\ncommittee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded\nrights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\n   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise\nof the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.\n   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-\ning and seizing private property.\n   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property\nwithout just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-\nout regard for their right to due process of law.\n   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was\nutterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\nBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\nunknowning technical violations.\n \n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\n                                REPORT\n                                of the\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\n                                of the\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\n                            SECOND SESSION\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n88-618 O\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\n \n \nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\n \n \nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\n \nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\ngangs from access to weapons.\n \nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\ntrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\nis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\n \nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\nprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\n \nBased on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\nand peaceful conclusion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nDennis DeConcini\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\nPostal Service and\nGeneral Government\n \nApril 7, 1993\n ",

But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries.\"[1]\n\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\n\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\n\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests.\" (A.

Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for\ndrug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.\n\nDon't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.\nEither banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations\ncollective I.Q. is about that of a potato.\n\nWhy do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,\nand NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the\nstuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the\nhell would they jump the gun?\n\n\nI really wonder.\n\nTo wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary c/o:\nPresidential Comment Line (fax)\n(202) 456-2461\n \nApril 17, 1993\n \nSir and/or Madam:\n \n \nI must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and\ncryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\n \nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\n\n\n\n\n\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\n \nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\n \nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\n\n\n\n\n\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\n \nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\n \nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can't believe it's happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Concerned,\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t[Signature]\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\nuni@acs.bu.edu\n",

    "context": "\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).",

    "context": "Archive-name: space/astronaut\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $\n\nHOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\n\n    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA\n    announcement.\n\n    Q. How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period.

    "context": "-*----\nI think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a\ndefinition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly\nand that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation's Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\neases one's defense.)\n\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little\nabout either and so have nothing to offer.",

    "context": "\n\nActually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are\n1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than\nnuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many\nfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n\n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n\nTrue.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\nthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a few\ndozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved\noxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will \nfind outside the laboratory.\n\nJohn",

But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\"\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes.

Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n \"...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled\n  north.

Neto):\n\nThis all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to\ndo with this.\n\nBackground first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as\nX accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- ",

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\nme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \ntelling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \nher corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \nwent down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \nSabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He \nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \napartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\nAll of my family had gathered there.\n   \nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\napartment.\n\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \nKarina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \nyou, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\nmicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\n\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\nsaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \ncan't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \nsomething, but she couldn't. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\nthen maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\n\"Maybe it'll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\ncontrol myself.\n\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \nsays, \"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What's his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \nthat's the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \nBut I didn't know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what's his number?\" She \nsays, \"I can't remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \nsays, \"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\"\n\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn't \nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \nfound out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \ntell them that they just can't do that.\" She still didn't know what was really\ngoing on. I said, \"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \nhappening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \nArmenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it's that serious \n. . . \" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \nand that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \"OK, \nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \nI'll send him over.\"\n\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \nunder Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \nwasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \ngrown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\neleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n. . . everything just like a war.\n\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \nMamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \nare they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\nand you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \nthere. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \ndaughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \ndon't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\nI said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \nsister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \ndressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \ntaking him.\n\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \ndidn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \nwhat they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\nwere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \nand said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \nthat he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \nI'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \nto his apartment.\n\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \nwasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \nzoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \nseeing it.\n\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\nIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \nwas simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n\nMany are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \nvictims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\nthemselves said that.\n\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \nmaybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \nthey weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \nMarina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \nshouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \nhours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\ning to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\nit's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \nThat's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \ncourse he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \nand Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\nThere's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\nbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\none another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \nhospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \nshe wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \ndo eat.\n\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \nraped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \nnothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \none got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \nmany hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\nafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \nThe situation was deplorable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\nI'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \nhere. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\nI didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\nthere is capable of anything.\"\n\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \nhadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \nwhat's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \nwell and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \ntwo or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \nMamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \nalive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\n\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\nGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \ncontained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\nhim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\nshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\nthat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\ndon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\ndon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \nthey didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n\nShirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \nWe didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\nconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \nquality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \nweren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \nwe can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \nmonths, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\nthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\"\n\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\nrays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \nthis? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\nwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\ncells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \nconfinement.\n\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \nwho went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \nloose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \nsisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \ncontinue looking for him.\n\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\nof me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\na prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \nall the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \nFenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\neven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \nslippers.\n\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \ndon't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \naxe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \nthrew them into the tub with water.\n\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\nidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n. . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \nthat high in gym class.\"\n\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\no'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \nwe'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n\nI'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \napartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \napartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \ndon't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\nout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \nhave a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n\nThe others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\ncall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\nsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\nthat's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\nBecause I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \npromised us apartments.\"\n\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \nchildren's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \nthe children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \nknew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\nenough blood here.\"\n\nMaybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \nKarina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\nThe woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \nhe sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \nfloor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \ntantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \nhave happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\n\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \ncut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\ntime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \nArmenians.\n\nI heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \nlistened to the woman's speech.\n\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \nthey find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \ntell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \nAzerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n\nWhen we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \noff. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \nwouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\nagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \ntelevision as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \nday. That's how it all was.\n\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\nZhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \ndoesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \nground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \ninjured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \nand their children: any way they could. \n\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\nand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \nescape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \nvery moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \nAzerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n\nRaya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\nAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \nreason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\n\nSo that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\nthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\ntion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\nspeaking our native tongue.\n\n   October 15,1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.",

Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His\n                body because that would have perpetrated the\n                resurrection--the very opposite of what they\n                desired.\n\n            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His\n                body because Pontius Pilate established guards\n                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be\n                stolen.\n\n            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples\n                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus\n                had risen from the dead.\n\n            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been\n                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He\n                *would indeed* rise from the dead.",

Is\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\nmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.\n\n\nFor non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why\ncertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't\nmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance\nrates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical\nmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they\nmust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\n\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\n\n\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\nbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\ncovered for basic care.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn't even consider a \"voucher\" approach\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\n\n\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\nnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\n\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer \n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \n1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\njust that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\nand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\n\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\nthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's\npublic health insurance plan.\n\ngld",

    "context": "\nYes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences,\nand that \"rules\" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\n\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \nsin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God's grace.\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt\t\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research\tPhone:\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\n  Laboratories\t\tFedex:\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas\tPostal:\t  P.O.

It does not go into\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\n\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\n---------------------\n\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\n  messages with your private key.\n\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\n\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\n\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\n  remain high.\n\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\n----------------------\n\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\n\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run \n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\n\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\n\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \n  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\n  authentication.\n\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\n----------------\n\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let's do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\n  unknown message.\n\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\n  the utils directory.\n\nLOCAL ATTACKS\n-------------\n\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\n  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.\n\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\n  passphrase.)\n\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between\n  convenience and security here.\n\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\n\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\n  cleartext password authentication.\n\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\n\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\n-------------------------\n\n- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\n  forwarding functions to work.",

The program \nfor the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of \nthe papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees \nat the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.\n\nIn addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the \nprogram committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for \ninformal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to \ndemonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. \nIf you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General \nChair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include \nhosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a \nbeach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included \nin the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.\n\nABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of \nthe University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent \nto the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are \navailable in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference \nparticipants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the \ndormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate \narrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is \nenclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. \nHowever, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire \na parking permit.\n\nTRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the \nSanta Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including \nAmerican, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service \nwill be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday \nand Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented \nin Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the \nnorth and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles \nnorth of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nREGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance \nat the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late \nregistrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space \nis available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached \nregistration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in \nfull before July 9, 1993.

    "context": "My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after\nhis marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.\nWe've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level\nfor most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.\n   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \"Why\nbe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\ncome back.\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\ncould think of.\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\nrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\nthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\nshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the\nbreak out in the open and done with.\n \n    I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\nthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\nappease an unappeasable,\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can't \"get away\" with treating\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\nbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\na horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or\nthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated\nbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me\nup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,\nand vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not\nfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*\nsomething, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting\nvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal\nmental chatter enough to listen for God.)\n  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is\nthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I\nconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?\n \nHere's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long\npost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and\ncharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on\nmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him\nand can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or\npost.\n \nThank you.",

    "context": "The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW\nas will be covered with this treatise.\n\nMUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)\nis the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from \nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\n\n\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\n\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\n\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\n\tall things.\n\n---------------------\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\nAllah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\n\n----------------------\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n\nA   D R O P L E T\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an\n\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\n\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \t\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \n\n\t\t MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \n\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\n\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\ndecree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\nOur'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\neffect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\nwhile being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has\nappointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\nand more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'\n   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger\nclaimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\nmerely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!'\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\nways.\n   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\n",

    "context": "\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can't allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The\nabove method is described, in more or less detail in:\n\n@inproceedings{Sloan86,\nauthor=\"Sloan, Jr., Kenneth R. and David Meyers and Christine A.~Curcio\",\ntitle=\"Reconstruction and Display of the Retina\",\nbooktitle=\"Proceedings: Graphics Interface '86 Vision Interface '86\",\naddress=\"Vancouver, Canada\",\npages=\"385--389\",\nmonth=\"May\",\nyear=1986  }\n\n@techreport{Curcio87b,\nauthor=\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\",\ntitle=\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and\nAnalysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\",\nnumber=\"TR 87-12-03\",\ninstitution=\"Department of Computer Science, University of Washington\",\naddress=\"Seattle, WA\",\nmonth=\"December\",\nyear=1987  }\n\n@article{Curcio89,\nauthor=\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\",\ntitle=\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and\nAnalysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\",\njournal=\"Vision Research\",\nvolume=29,\nnumber=5,\npages=\"529--540\",\nyear=1989  }\n \n",

    "context": "\nFrom: \"Preston K. Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\n\n\nFolks,\n\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\nthe following to the WSJ.\n\n-----\n\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\n\nPreston K. Covey\n\n\n\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\n",

Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n\t     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".  If you know of people\nthat'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\n",

There\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\nthat John would prefer.\n\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get 'em in and get 'em\nout\".\n\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}",

    "context": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Unconventional peace proposal\n\n\nA unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.\n---------------------------------------------------------- by\n\t\t\t  Elias Davidsson\n\nThe following proposal is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\n\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\n\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\nunresolved conflict exists.\n\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\nand nations.\n\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\n\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\npolitical means have failed.\n\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\n\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\n\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\n\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\n\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\n\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\n\n\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\ngovernments and international organizations.\n\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\n\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\nattempt to identify some of these:\n\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\n\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\nabove)\n\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\nattitudes.\n\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\n\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\ndiscussion and enrichment.",

As far as\n  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\n\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\n     provocation is required.\n\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\n\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\n       as document checks.\n\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\n       armed response.\n\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\n       if necessary.",

If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be\nconsistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may\napply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept\nthis premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has\nbehaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n/(me)\n/[football example deleted]\n\n/(hudson)\n/Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the\n/players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

    "context": "Subject: Re: Eugenics\n/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.",

The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,\nbut great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a \ndifferent technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do\nnot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking \non water until a little doubt crept in.\n\nDoesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \"what is man that you [God] \nshould care for him, but you have made him just a little lower \nthan the angels\"?\n\nI probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David\nwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath\nwas, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.\n\nRemember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what\nhe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.\nI always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that\nhis whole life, probably anticipating an \"attaboy\" from the \nMessiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything\nand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say\nhow can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.\nJesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.\n\nJesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid\ngetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing\nadultery, we can control our own desires. \n\nI realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other\npeople see this. \n\n\n(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)\n\nYour point about how \"hard\" other religions are is a good one, just \nas your \"Parting Question\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims\nworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \"submission\".\nHindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \"God\" is impersonal. \nIs God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little\nmore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater \nto be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but\nyou're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more\nI must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my\nconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's\nconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology\nthen maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.\n\nAre there any former (or present) \"Eastern Religion\" members here \nwho could comment?",

As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.

The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.

It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\n",

Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, \nalmost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?\nSimilarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save\nanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  \nThat leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, \nespecially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,\nthe serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,\nthose two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be\nable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       ",

    "context": "\n       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\nwith something else in mind and \"propoganda\" put out by its supporters.\n\n       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\n\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*\nmeans because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.\n\n\n       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\non earth did you make a point of calling them \"propogranda?\"  That\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\n\n\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe\nthey no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were\ngood arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\n\n\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\n\n\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\nhad less power?\n\n\n        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\n\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\nis \"in principle\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\n\n\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\ngovernment to \"attack\" which presents them with the best chance of\ngetting what they want.  With national \"interest groups\" it is simply\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \n\"contributions\" to make.  \n\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\nmedicine, and most other questions.\n\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn't done what it\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\nit can impose its will on the lower.\n\n      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\nto a local crime?\n\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to \"sell\"\nit to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \"special interests\"\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\n\n\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\nin effectiveness.\n\n\n       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\nof educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\nstate.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\n\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\n\n\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\nis significantly reduced.\n\n\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\ndecisions a good thing.\n\n\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\n\n       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\n\n       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\nare more corrupt.  \n\n\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\nWhich was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\nthe House.\n\n\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\n\n\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\nit wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\nthe Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\n\n\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's\nanything resembling a record.\n\n\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\nnot been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\ngot through something more than a bare majority\n\n\n       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster\nto a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.\n\n\n       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*\nargument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.\n\n\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\nthe *federal* system against action.\n",

According to the above poster, we must believe\n in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The \n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\n\n\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\n\n\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a \n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\n  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  \n\n\n Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\n doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:\n \n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\n\n Weak atheism   - \"I don't believe in a god\"       a negative belief\n \n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)\n \n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\n \n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\n \n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\n \n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\n \n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) \n\n\n\n Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not\n  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always \n  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival\n  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.\n\n",

The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.

The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.",

    "context": "Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\n\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \n\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \n\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \n\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \n\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\" \nhave agendas of their own.  \n\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \n\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \n\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \n\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \n\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \n\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \n\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \n\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \n-- has wound up being shed.  \n\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \n\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \neveryone will benefit.  \n\nL.

I got news for you.\nYours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you\nbecause your god doesn't exist.\n\n\nI am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.\nWhat I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.\n\n\nBe true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life.\"\n\n\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\n",

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\n\n -30-\n",

    "context": "I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\nBible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\nof Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\n\tBut recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\nviews about other human beings. \n\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\nweird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\nwha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.\nIt's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\nnot being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\n\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\nthis entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\nChristians are a problem.\n\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\nProtestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at\nrecently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\nProtestant thought.)\n\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\nsane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that\nthey're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you think\nthere might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?",

    "context": "\n\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \nreally happened. \n\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \n\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\n\n   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:\n\n  Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed\n  Bohor Levy, tailor               killed\n  Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed\n  Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed\n  David Aroguete                   killed\n  Moussa Lerosse                   killed\n  Gioia Katan                      killed\n  Meryem Malki                     killed\n  Soultan Gharib                   killed\n  Isaac Sabah                      wounded\n  Moche Fahmi                      wounded\n  David Sabah                      wounded\n  Moise Bensignor                  killed\n  Sarah Bendi                      killed\n  Jacob Jaffe                      wounded\n  Aslan Halegna                    wounded....>>\n\nSerdar Argic",

Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling\nis that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or\nIsrael, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.\nWith regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights\nin Israel as do all other Israelis.\n\n\nWho are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think\nyou should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their\nsupporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my\nknowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,\nas much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens\nof Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli\ncitizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find\nthemselves.\n\n",

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn't happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.",

Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

    "context": "\n\nActually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.",

    "context": "Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)",

    "context": "\nGawd, I love Windows :-)\n\n\nYou'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them\nfresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.\n\n\nYou're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a\nswap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky\nstuff in a PC environment.\n\n\nA reasonably accurate prediction...\n\n\nHere's a brief description of how DOS stores files:\n\nThere are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\n\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not\nimportant right now.\n\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\ncontains the next section of the file.\n\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\n\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\nwhich says it's the last cluster in the file.\n\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\nsubmission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\n\nNow let's do a bit of a post-mortem:\n\n\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\nobviously, are made up.))\n\n\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that\nC:\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\n\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\n\n\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\namount which exceeded available disk space...\n\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\nproblem occurs.

    "context": "Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.\n\n[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most\nof our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]\n\nChrist warns that anyone who \"breaks one of the least of these\ncommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in\nthe kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\npartisan theology.\n\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.",

Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  \nfrom aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  \npartition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  \ndefensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.\n\n***\nFirst, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  \nidea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  \nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem.

    "context": "THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\n \n     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training\nvideotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military\narm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\nHamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which\nobtained and translated the tape.)\n \n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have\ntwo daughters.\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\nSecurity Services.\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\n     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\nHe's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\nIsraeli soldier.\n     There's another group of collaborators who perform an even\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\nduty to execute him.\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\nuncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\ndoubt, then he is executed.\n     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.\nBut when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\nobtained in the form of a confession.\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\ninformation we need.\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\nconfess as well.\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\nhimself confesses his crimes. \n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\nexecution.\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\n",

I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.",

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\"\nHeflin said.  \"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives.\"\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.",

    "context": "Hi there,\n\nI've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\n\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\n*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a\n*** different version.\n\nThe routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They\nare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\n\"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \"windows\".\n\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\n\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with\nit whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,\nand maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)",

So I went and \npicked up this cheapo \"Motorcycle battery and charging system tester\"... \nHook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on \"Very good charge\"... Start \nthe engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER.

I'd think it would be \ndarned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...\n \n Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system?

    "context": "[...}\n\nLiving through those days at the age of 20 and following\nthe internal and external news gives me that knowledge\nand position.  In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free\npress at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't\nheard anything from any international source about any\nconcentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey.\nHowever, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well \nrecognized POW camp.  \n\nI see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have\ndecided to acknowledge their existence first but later\nchanged their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do\nyou think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject \nof Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.\n\n\nYou don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state\nin its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN \nsince the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of\nTurkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short \nlived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the \ninternal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it\nbefore wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions \nagainst Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after\nthe 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say?\nI am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had\ntheir own share too.\n\n\nHave you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks\nmediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any\nmissing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?\nI heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and\nInternational press.  He keeps saying that \"This was no\nlonger an issue for peace talks.\"  Also, you don't want\nme fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic\nhad posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as \na Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions \namong Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish \ncustody.\n\n[..]\n\n\nI am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was\ngiven to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish\nGoverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some\nof their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in\nlate August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international \ncommunity, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it\nan issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN\ncondemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?  \n\nBTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta\nand nobody got hurt in those events?  \n\n\nLike I said before.  There is even a different opinion among\nGreek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who\ngoverned the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes\nto cover up their tracks 8-).  I hope Turkish Army does't have \nsame type of morons for the security of Turkiye.  However, this must \na good subject for a movie script.  One should inform Oliver Stone     \nabout this.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf this is what you understood from the paragraph above,\nyou better let your computer system administrator check\nthe character conversion tables in your system.  If yours are\nOK, I should inform mine 8-).",

Steve Avery, for example,\nwas rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.\nHis subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie\nyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so\nand then rebound.\n\nBob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had\ngood numbers immediately.\n\nI am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and\nDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up\nthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it\ndidn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

It's a sports fans dream (especially\nif that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's\naway at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,\nthen Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed\nColeman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two\nseperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they\nboth happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!\n\n\nLike I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I\nwant. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly\nsports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite\nAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:\n\n\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\n\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\n\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\n \t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\n\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\n\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\n\t  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\n\t  being reported on WIP.\n\n\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\n\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\n\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\n\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\n\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.",

    "context": "There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among\nSouthern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\n\n *\n\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\n(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\nMasons.)\n\nThe SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\n\nAnyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\n\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\naren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)\n\n\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\ninfluenced how the report came out.\n\n *\n\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\n\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your\nmileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\nMilton:  \"We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq,\n          cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then\n          sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk\n          chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.\"",

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil",

And so it is that the whole \n  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n  Tartar villages.

This is the worst crime in history. \nIt happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian \ndictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst \nways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable \nof such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian \ngenocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.\n\nPeople of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were \nkilled in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there \nare those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, \ndespite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been \nwell documented over the past six decades.

Even if\n  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the\n  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which\n  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the\n  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the\n  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution\n  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews\n  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that\n  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that\n  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and\n  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>\n\n\n  page 21:\n\n  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\n  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)\n\n\n  page 41:\n\n <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\n of Europe.\n\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\n\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\n in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\n Greek towns...>>\n\n page 43:\n\n  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\n the situation.>>\n\n\n page 46:\n\n <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\n particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\n the Orthodox.>>\n\n page 46:\n\n <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\n interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\n countries to Ottoman domains.>>\n\n page 151:\n\n  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>\n\n  page 161:\n\n  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\n  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success\n  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both\n  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough\n  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success\n  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve\n  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear\n  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable\n  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.\n  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their\n  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the\n  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\n  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>\n\n\n(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:\n\n  page 32:\n\n  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles\n  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear\n  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly\n  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and\n  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob\n  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They\n  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will\n  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German\n  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,\n  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest\n  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you\n  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with\n  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out\n  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain\n  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are\n  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.\n  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us\n  lives in peace and freedom.

The properly-formed conscience can\nbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something\nso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess\nanything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were\ndiscussing the \"mind\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,\nas it were; and half spiritual. \n\n?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\n?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\n?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\n?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\n?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\n?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\n?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nNow you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\ninfallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \nChristianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\n \n?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\n?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\n?cannot be certain.\n\nThis argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a\nconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me\nof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of\na measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying\nto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\nnot subject to the experimental method. \n\n?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n?\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n?

    "context": "{Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still\nprivate in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}\n\n\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know\nit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a\ndifferent culture.\n\n\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld",

    "context": "April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):\n\nBasically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied \nterritories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe \ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTim: \n\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \nor \"visitors\").\n\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \nfrom its territory.\n\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\n\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled? For example,\n\thow could such \"guarantees\"/\"controls\" be added to the\n\tPalestinian PISGA proposals?\n\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \"buffer zone\", gives\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\ncould (and *would*, if not \"controlled\" somehow) EASILY return to the \ntraditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*\nensure that that will not happen.",

Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\nstandoff ensued.\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\ninsane.\n\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\nagents against the compound.\n\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\nimplementation of the decision.\n\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\ncircumstances.\n\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\nhas been learned now.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\nwith --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\nfirst and then the other.\n\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\ncan't do it at once.\n\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\nI was given were the following:\n\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\nmembers to come out.\n\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\nthe passage of time.\n\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions.\n\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\nincrease with the passage of time.\n\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\nsignificance.\n\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\ntoday.\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\nto unfold.\n\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\nchildren.\n\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\ndecide that way?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\nevidence we have.\n\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\njust began to spin downward.\n\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\nThat's what they thought.\n\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\nhave gas masks?\n\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\nyou in agreement with that?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\ncountry.",

    "context": "\nLooking at [1] we find that during Roman times \"Tyre vied with Sidon\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period\"; that Tyre was\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\nthat \"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\" was the\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\nalong with other seaports, \"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\nand even Chinese trade\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\npopulation by \"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\nof growth\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to\nthe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  \n\n[2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a\ncountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.\n\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\nDon't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n\nThey had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:\nTyre \"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\"\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the\nprophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that\nI haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to\nthe conclusion that you were quoting Josh.\n\n(I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books\nin Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so\nmuch at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)",

EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate. \n\t     \n\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n\t     \n\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n\t     \n\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.  \n\t     \n\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people. \n\t     \n\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime. \n\t     \n\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n\t     \n\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \na brighter and more peaceful future.\n\t     \n\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n\t     \n\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n\t     \n\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \nAttorney General.\n  \n\t     \n\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \ndialogue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \ntax.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\n\t     \n\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \naffordable health care system.\n\t     \n\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \njobs is one.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \nwe need to do that.\n\t     \n\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \nsafety of the public depends on that.  \n\t     \n\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \nreach some accord.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \nconsistent with that.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you.",

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n",

He  \ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \nold U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  \nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \nthe whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \nstate of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \nBabylon \"Babylon the Great\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \nearth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \ndon't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \nmost powerful nation on earth.\n\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \nof consideration.",

EDT\n\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? \n\t     \t  \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we \nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \n11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \n12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the \nvarious groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A photo op with Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the lunch?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are no meetings --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President been given any information by the \nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \nVietnamese on that subject?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \nof business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll \ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't \ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's \nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \nabout first.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \nyesterday about the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many times?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \nnight.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the outcome of that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind \nof an agreement on a jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \nway flexible on this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going \nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll \ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \nkind of an agreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you check that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\n\t     Q\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \nscale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down \nto where Dole will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it \nas he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs \npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \nwe reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the \nmoment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress \nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other \nRepublicans yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I \nwouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were led to believe that the President called \nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \nbut it was both.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In the President's mind, are they linked \npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what \narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \npackage, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs \npackage through the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \nnow with Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \nSenate for the jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other \nthan Shelby?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a \nvote.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about Kohl?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Kohl and Feingold?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll \ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, \nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \nfunding if this jobs package doesn't pass.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \nother Republicans again today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but \nagain, I wouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \nany other states today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of \nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \nthink it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \nup, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \nhow their states would benefit from this package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you share those with us?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent \nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \nbeen given?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think \nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \nhas not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add \nto that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going \nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't \nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public \ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think \nI want to add to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In February, though, the President said that this \nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \nchange its mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They're \nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \nspecific options that will be covered by the President's health care \nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \non it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being \nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President's \ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then suddenly --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \ntax.\n\n\t     Q\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \nhasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \nlooking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and \nno decisions have been made.\n\n\t     Q\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \ntask force is working.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \nall options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're \nconsidering all options.\n\n\t     Q\t  But that's not the impression that the President \nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \nnot on the table, not an option. \n\n\t     Q\t  \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Bring him on.\n\n\t     Q\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President's \nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna \nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \n--\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a \nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \ncouple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We \nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Is it because he has very few options?\n\n\t     Q\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the \ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \nthe President?  \n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at \nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \ncontext, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been \nmade, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a \ndecision on.\n\n\t     Q\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \nthough he specifically ruled it out?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \nthis form of taxation?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The \nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \nthey're looking at is the VAT. \n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \nthat you were telling us that it was not?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of \ntheir drafting of options is.  I don't know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \nconsideration?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's \ncomments.\n\n\t     Q\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise \nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made \non how to pay for the health care plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm asking whether the projections --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how \nthe plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going \nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \nyou can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \nuntil you know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer \nmodels on a number of possible packages.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \n\n\t     Q\t  The question is whether they have now determined \nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're \nnot going to answer until -- there's a number of options being \nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \n--\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \nin his --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \nnature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular \nbriefings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, you have.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not \nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \nhim as an option.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of \nwhat's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't \nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of \npaying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  \nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \nit's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process \nof the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  \nIt's something that the working groups will present to him among the \nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not \ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \nhealth care issues are being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's your statement from this podium that no \ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \nthe option has not been presented to him.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \nby George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \nnothing to add to what's already been said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \nso that it would be less regressive?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what \nmight happen if.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \nyou'd exclude food and energy --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific \nstructure of a decision that hasn't been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's \ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \ngroups?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you check for us, because that's a real \nimportant credibility question?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the task force was brought together this \nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \nand a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be \nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  \nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \nadd.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if \nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \nit's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \nus.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come \nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or \ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about \nthis issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All we were trying to find out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out \nand I've given you the answers, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made \nit an option again.  That's the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you \ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously \nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll \npresent it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \nthe table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \nhis mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he change his mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a \ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's \nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \nthis we'll let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he \nchanged his mind or the working groups think they're authority \nexceeds the President's.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to look at all options; they've done that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \navailable. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will \nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \nthrough the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the \npresidential tax forms.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we have one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of \na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \nyour questions about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they file a joint form?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did he file it?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No backgrounder today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \none day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \nforce in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it \nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards \nBosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight \ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've \ninitiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \nalthough we're considering a number of options right now.  If the \nSerbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on \nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \nwhich we've been saying regularly.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them \nevery day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which doesn't work so --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \nWe're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \nthe 26th.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us \nany documentation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to \nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been no -- you have not been able to \nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia \nand we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be \nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \nyou'd like.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't \nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \nprovide something along those lines?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the \ndetails of that package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \nget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the \n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering \nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \nconcern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \nin the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit \nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to \nwork with Congress to make that happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \nthis process moves forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \nCongress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs \npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \ngive kids something to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who are they?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three \norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \nof Police Associations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \n$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So this would be the $700 million that's in the \nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \nmillion already in the budget.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \nFiscal '94 --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact \nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \ncalling Bob Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\nDoes the White House feel that you're getting too close to these \nChambers of Commerce?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \nbeing too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled \nby the support we've received from the national Chamber and local \nChambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on \nthis and other initiatives.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the status of the President thinking about \ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost \ncertainly go.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All three days?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be \nthere yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it open to coverage?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't \nmade a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or \nwhat --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about an AIDS czar?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Anything on the weekend?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this \nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been \ndiscussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic \nretreat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on \nright now is the radio address on Saturday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any travel plans?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He's not going to be off campaigning for his \nstimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely \nthat we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going \nto be focused on the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.",

    "context": ": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\n: couple become \"married\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.\n\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\n\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\n\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\npoint of intercourse.\n\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\nand Joseph went to bed together.\n\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\ndescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\n\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be\ncorrected on that point!)\n\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\n\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?\n\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\nactually consummating our marriage.

    "context": "\"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be\nImpossible\"\n\nToday (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the\nheadline shown above. The article starts with \"A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible.\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research \"is a real question for me.\"\nO'Connor said \"everything is fair game,\" including\n\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet.\"\n\nO'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\"",

    "context": "Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6\n\n[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]\n\n\nMany people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite\nautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)",

In fact, it is the combination of the two\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\n\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\nto spread the word.\"\n\nAll these quotes btw are from:\n\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\n\n\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\n\n\"Do you, too, measure\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\n\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\n\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\nthe sport is all there is.\"\n\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\n\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\nthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\ndoesn't take much sophistication to understand.\"\n\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\nof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.",

If that's correct, end of one point...\n\nGregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept.\nHis comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,\nand are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member\nof a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways\nof the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.\nThe big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West\nwe have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control\nand of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think\nthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say\n\"in agreement\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the\nsecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may\nhave chosen.\n\nWith that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\"legally\" as most\npeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once\nthey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree\nthat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there\nany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past\ngroup member.\n\nA religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties\nof a group member.

In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular\nauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.\nOutside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.

This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc\nseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the\njuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor.

This stopped the wavy interference\neffect on the computer monitor next to it. \nNow on to your problem.

    "context": "It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the\ntradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.\nAs the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\nmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\nfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\nSince we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\na predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\nbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.",

THIS VERSION\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \nto contact me.\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\n\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\n\n********\n\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\n-------------------------------------\n\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \n\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \nof three-dimensional molecules?\n\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \nactually doing it?\n\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \ndo with this package???' , read on.\n\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\n",

What \nwas he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't \nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \nthe government--why my husband was killed.\n\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\nHe doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we \nlived. I say, \"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\" He looked \nagain and said, \"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \nmany people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \nyou can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \"Down with the \nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's \naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \ncan't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \nAnd my son says, \"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \ndidn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \nsimply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what's going on, what \nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what \nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \neach second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their \nheads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \ndon't know.\n\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \ndear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \nyou afraid of, they're just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \nVocational School. \"Don't fear,\" he said, \"it's nothing, nothing all that \nbad.\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \nWhen I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \nthere and I said, \"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don't be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\ndifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \"You speak\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\" He says \"Close the window\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it's\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \nThings had calmed down slightly.\n\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \nget up.\" I say, \"Today's my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren't you going \nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \nyou going?\" He says, \"I'm going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \noutside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\nme, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\n\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\nit was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\nsaid, \"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\"\n\nTires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \nstanding on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \nthey've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \no'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\no'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \nI'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \ndon't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \ninside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They've killed\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \ngo to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \ndaughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \nand went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \nhere, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \nand I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \nUncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \ngarage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \nEmma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \nI'm coming too.\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \nhere with us, I'm go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \nEmma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \nthere . . . wheezing.\"\n\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don't go near him, \nor we'll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and \nsaid, \"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \nAlik, maybe he'll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\n\nI went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \nthere, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \nlying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\nwindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\no'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don't\ngo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\nalive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\"\n\nAt six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \nwanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\nsaid, \"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\"\n\nIt's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\" Now Shagen \njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they've \nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \ndead . . . he's alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\" \nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \nlike that there was no hope left.\n\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \npeople.\n\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa's been killed.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \nyes, that's our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor's office\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We're taking care of all that,\ndon't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\nsays, \"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\none second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\nlike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\"\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli\nSadukhov.\n\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \nhospital until the 4th.\n\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let's go.\" And the women, our \ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They're going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\nstill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let's \ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can't look, no.\"\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\" He says, \n\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\nbeen injured at work . . .\n\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \ndown, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \nwe've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\n\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \nget here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\"\n\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I'm \nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \narson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\nsays, \"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \nif it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\n\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you're \ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \n\"Yes.\" \"And now you're telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \nforgot!\" Like that.\n\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What's your nationality?\" He \nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he's an\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \nthat's where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\n\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\nwere taken. He says he didn't take them\n\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\nit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \nhave the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\nI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven't straightened \neverything out, I think that's unjust.\"\n\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\npercent of his body . . .\n\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \nArmy. And now they're fatherless...\n\nI couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\nyears' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' \ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\ncreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn't a \nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\n\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\" I \nstill don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\ndon't understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\n\n   May 19, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

    "context": "UPI Washington DC, Update Desk\t\t\t4/15/93\n\n  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been\n  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\n  of jobs creation.\n\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\n\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\n  \"It's the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \n\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\n\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\n  suspect it will\", he added.\n\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's \n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\n\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\n  of gun control\".\n\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\n\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we'll\n  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\n\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\n  guns\".\n\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won't\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\n\n  - end article -\n\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \n\n                                Bill Vojak\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\n\t\t\t\tNRA, ILA,\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take \nquestions today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton \nadministration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the \nUnited States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that \nthe Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has \nsaid that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, \nthis is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't \ncome to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look \nseriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, \nwe're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in \nthe U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the \nnegotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something \nthe President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the \ntable.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How much longer are you going to give them to come \nto the table, George?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's been a long time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value \nadded tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by \nreporters, he said -- quote -- \"That is a radical change in the tax \nsystem of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to \nlook at in the years ahead.\"  Questioned again about it later he \nsays, \"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \nstart considering it, I'll tell you.\"  It wasn't a trial balloon or \nanything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \nquestion.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\n- \"Certainly we're looking at a VAT.\"  What's gone on?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \nreviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  \nAnd as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not \ngoing to comment on decisions that haven't been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But you have also said from this podium time and \ntime again --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that that was not under consideration.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes.  Clinton says, \"It is not something that is \nnow under consideration.\"  Is that no longer true?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \nShalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \nmade of any kind.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if \nit was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \ndidn't tell us about it or --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \nconsideration or if it was something to be proposed?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  \"If we start considering I'll tell you.\"\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  \"If we start considering it, I'll tell you.\"  \nThat's a direct quote.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \nnumber of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \nThe President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \nproposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \ncast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \nthe health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \nlooked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \ndifferent proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \nof this option?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed \non any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \nforce on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that \nthat's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \nthe task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe \nthat that's been presented to him, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him \nwhat his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very \ndeliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \nmade.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-\nmaking point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this is still under consideration, that's a \nchange, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about \nthree weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \nabout the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \nremember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \nnot the case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has \nbeen presented to the President as something that is being looked at \nat some level in the task force.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \noptions that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \nout.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \nbeing looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \nit doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the \ndecision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \ndifferent options.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out \nnow, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When a guy says in February --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \nlooking at the widest possible range of options.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it \nbefore; they're looking at it now.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working \ngroups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \nnet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \nto sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \nare saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \nlooking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \nruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those \nare the President's words.  Those are very clear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny \nthat within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \nit out?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I \nthink what we did was refer back to the President's words and say \nthey stand.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So don't they stand any longer?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \nyears it was ruled out.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \ndid say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \ntrack, and as I said, I don't believe --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Separate from the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been \npresented to the President.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are they considering something that the President \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has ruled out?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \nconsider a VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \npresented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \noptions.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \nlisten to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \nOhio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \nsystem.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \nmight be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \ncase, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what \nyou're asking.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \nrestructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \ncare, for example.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or anything else.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or anything else.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It was always in the context of substituting for \nother taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has that change, too?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that still his view?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those \nspecific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \nworking groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \nthey have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \nof a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \ndecision?  No, he has not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the \nPresident's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \nruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \nreform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \nspecifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \ngoes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the \nPresident concerned about that sort of thing?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's \nconcern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \npossible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most \nthorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \ndifferent alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \nsomething like that it's certainly something the President will \nexplain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \nlines.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \nPresident rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \ntable later if a more persuasive argument is made?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably \ntrue.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \nhas not made a proposal.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open \nto it before?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to \nthe argument.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \nshort-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in \nChilicothe?  He's now open to it --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \nthat it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \nsomething he was proposing, not something he was floating.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \nwords -- \"It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we \nstart considering it, I'll tell you.\"  You're now acknowledging, are \nyou not, that it is under consideration and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task \nforce has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \nPresident has not made a decision on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But the door is open for the President to \nreconsider including this as part of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \nlooking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \nbehalf of the VAT to him?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that \nif -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know \nthat they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they \nshould present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \nare looking at.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \nasking these questions in context of a decision that the President \nhas made, only about what the President is considering?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \nacknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \nVAT.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And the President will consider it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \nargument if it is presented to him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \nthink that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \ngroups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can I ask you another question about \nBosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, he wants us to stay on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, he got out of that swamp.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \nReggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \nthat if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \nout -- quote -- \"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \narms embargo together with our allies.\"  That seems to go a bit \nfurther than what you've just said --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \nsaid.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \nwhat Reggie --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \nthis is something that's under consideration.  It is something he \nwill consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the \ntable.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's \ngoing to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the \nsanctions.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  \nAnd we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \nthat that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \nBartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \nworking on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \npressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \nas well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question is whether there's a timetable for \nconsideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \nnot the sanctions.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \nsanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \nthe arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \ninternally and with our allies.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \nU.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \nsomething that's under consideration, and this is something that we \ntake quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \nknow the consequences of failing to come to the table.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have they been given a deadline?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \nand it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why \nshould the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \nwhen so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the \nfighting in Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of \nyour question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \neffect.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What effect?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \nour warnings, then they will face the consequences.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \nthe Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \nshipments through.  We can brief more fully --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \nhad?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's \nstopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to \npress for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \nwill continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \nI'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't \nhappened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \nweaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \nto the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \n-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the \nUnited States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \nthe Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \nwe'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going \nto --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But on that deadline?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but \nwe're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \nby around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \nto bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \nactions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this awfully incremental?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step \napproach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to \ncontinue to do that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \nall these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \ntheir goals and then what's the purpose?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \nSerbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \ndifferent fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're \npursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \ntightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \nembargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \ncontinue to do that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \ngetting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \ncampaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, \nonce they're entrenched --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're \ngoing to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're \ngoing to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't \nsee into the future.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \nsay they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \ntry and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \nshow that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \nWhat's your strategy to counter that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \nwe're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \nthe very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \nwill provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \ncities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \nout the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \nWe're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to \npoint up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \nRepublicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \nthey can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \nthe House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \nit before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does it strike anybody in the \nadministration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President \ndid this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \"a \nreaffirmation of a promise of America\"?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the \npromise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \npotential. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Government-funded jobs?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \nAbsolutely.  That is the promise of America.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \n-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \nit.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \nwill be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \npackage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we've \nbeen told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \nnew jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \nlike 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when \nyou do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \nreceive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \njob effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One to four because it's three months.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \nmisspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \nfor these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \nprivate sector?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \nthat there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you \npay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to \nthe private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \nwork at Time-Warner?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \nsomebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to \nbe the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \nthere would be grants to businesses.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate \nRepublicans this week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \nNo, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \nWhite House.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Getting any closer to get the votes?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Anybody leaning your way?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \nsomething of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup \nleaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \nimpact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \nsay yesterday in his report?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \nI can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would \nleave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \nreturned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \nHouse from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \nagain, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \nfinal resolution to a broader political settlement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective \nbreakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \nCan we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \nimpacted?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \nyes.  And I think we can get it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you make that generally available?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And could you do it by the component of the \nstimulus?  In other words --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know \nthat we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how \ndeeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \nsummer jobs and other jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \nJeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \nstates?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but \nthey're press releases.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the \nbenefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \nthat today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \nAnd I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \ncreates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \nHampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \nthis is important. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where are the releases going?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To whom?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we get it?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why don't you put them out here as well?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  \nBut as soon as we can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states \nwhere there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many \nas we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and \nwe're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's \nschedule?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are press releases going along to states where he's \nvisiting?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that \nprobably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, as the President goes about the business of \ndefending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what \nseems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with \ndeficit spending rather than \"if it's so important, why not come up \nwith the funding for it\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \nhow do you answer that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \nfor it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \npackage over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\nstart for jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add \nto the deficit this year?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over \ntime.  I didn't say that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \nbeginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\ndeficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \nover time our budget fully pays for this program.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What you're saying is that there are savings that \nwould cover this if it were this year in future years?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I \nsaid.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \ndebt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by \n$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You mean you're reducing it below what it would \nhave been?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the \nnational debt over the period of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from \nwhat it would have been.  That's true.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, has any decision been made about the White \nHouse or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming \nup in a week and a half?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's \nschedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic \nretreat in Jamestown that weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he address it by phone?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a \nlittle far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \nthe speech?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that \nat some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  \nI don't know the schedule on it, though.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in \nconjunction with the event?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President \ngoing to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign \nthe biodiversity treaty that day?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on \nthe biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but \nI would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around \nthen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie \nMcGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't \nknow exactly what.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When is Earth Day?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why is it you know that he is going to have a \nstatement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a \nstatement on the gay rights march?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going \nto meet or when he's going to meet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't \nbe surprised if he did, though.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and \nthe President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of \nissues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and \nthe trade issues between the two countries.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There was some expectations that a second aid \npackage to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if \nI understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status \non that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on \nand, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked \nabout the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to \ncontinue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    We will not then make any kind of announcement \nduring the two-day meeting?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that when you're going to make one?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Bentsen said that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So did Christopher.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I \nbelieve it is more likely that the announcement will come out of \nTokyo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, has there been further consideration here \nabout going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's \nnot something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you all have a position or do you support \nImmigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United \nStates?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, there was a report today about the --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) \n\t     \n\t     Q\t     about the pace of appointments and says that \nPresident Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \nthat people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \npace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's \nappointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \nnoncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --\n(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's \nabout the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \nfarther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \nmultiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \nthe process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \nwe'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \n\t     \n\t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \nbackground check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \nthan our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're \nworking on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that because of Nannygate?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of \nit, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In the story this morning, you were at \napproximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \nbehind in winning confirmations.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks \ncomes into play.  That's the problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's the background checks problem?  Because I \nmean, you have a Democratic Senate --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the \nappointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \nthe forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where \nthe problem is.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the President doing this afternoon, and \nwhat's on the plan for tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just \noffice meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of \nissues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then \nhe'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on \nthe stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And \nFriday is the Miyazawa meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, \nGeorge?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the \nJapanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but \nwe'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these \nvisits.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you \nknow what that was about?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group \nof us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Reverend Jackson.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, \nme, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Talking about Haiti?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban \npolicy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from \nMississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going \non to Los Angeles.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he request the meeting?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual \ncontact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of \nissues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords \ntonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at \nall on this?\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, \nsure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us about the contacts?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure -- \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to \nhim and they just has a general talk about the package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And did he express his support for it now, or is he \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the \nconversation, but there have been conversations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --\nelective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care \npackage.  Is this something the President is considering?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's \nbeen looked at, but no decisions have been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether \nabortions will be covered by the President's health plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your \nmeeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice \nabout what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of \nthe verdict in L.A.?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the \nsituation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic \ndevelopment and other issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be \nhelpful for the President to go there or not?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of \nissues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, \nI need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments \nthat you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard \non a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue \nto do that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your \ntalks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't \nhave any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 \npeople or --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've \ntalked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Anyone leaning your way?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just \ngoing to keep working through Tuesday.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END                    1:10 P.M. EDT",

    "context": "I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the \"happy Mac face\" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?\nThanks a lot.    E.\n",

You make\n\tit sound as if your opinion is somehow an undisputable fact.\n\n\tMany would interpret the passages you cite very differently.\n\n\t(Many have--several of the great theologians you mentioned do that \n\tvery thing.  These were people who had much more expertise in the\n\tinterpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading\n\tthis newsgroup.  To say that all of them are wrong and you are right\n\tis, in my opinion, (notice those last three words) coming pretty darn\n\tclose to the sin of pride.  \n\n\tIn the future I would suggest you not be so absolutist in your \n\tinterpretations, especially when contradicting highly respected\n\tdoctors of Christianity.",

    "context": "}For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between\n}Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out\n\nHate to shatter your self image of perfection that  you appear to hold, but\nyour language is wrong: Jim and me.\n\n}I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\n}Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to\n}understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\n}have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\n}out of context.  \n\nOf course not - just the ones you disagree with.  Q.E.D.\n\n}>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for\n}>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a\n}>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?\n}\n}Jim replied by saying \n}>Did I either ask or assert that?\n}\n}But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\nSo?  As of then, and pointing out a specific instance.  Wrongo again.\n\n}>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\n}>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\n}>may be held responsible for that action?\n}\n}Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\n}context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\n}t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nSo?  Check the newsgroups?\n\n}Does \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\n}didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\n}out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\n}question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\nTelepathy again?  You claim to know what I \"want\".\n\n}But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \n}gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\n}concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\n}the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nNo.  YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours.\n\n}Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\n\nMaybe to the ignorant.  I accept your classification.\n\n}More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\n}number of my articles?  \n\nDo you know what \"uncountably large\" means?  It does not appear so.\n\n}Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\n}but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\n}Well, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nI am not suprised.\n\n}But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\n\nThat does not appear to be the case.  The appearance of your \"Argument\"\nis more like that Captain Kirk would have gotten from Mr. Spock - written\nby a stagehand at Paramount.\n\n}Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it\n}through your induction engine and see what pops out.  ",

You do not need\nto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little\nmore.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you\nthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should\nlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,\nabout the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled\nby drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,\nthough, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault\nfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.\nOddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my\nliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by\ncars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the\nfact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with\nthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline\nwill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything\nover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe\nthey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....\n\njust curious, and my .otwo",

Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n\"What is atheism?\"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\natheism\".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\n\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?\"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\nthat has a \"meaning\".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?\"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n\"What sort of harm?\"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse.\"\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?\"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?\"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?\"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n\n   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n\n   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\n   courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\n   styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\n   reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\n   introduction...\n\nTwo other Intros to consider:\n\nThe \"Introduction\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.\nThe references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but\nthe book contains a wealth of information.\n\nPerrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more\nmodern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the\nauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order\nof composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the\ndevelopment of the NT.\n\n   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the\n   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.\n\nA slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \"OK\" but not great.  One\nparticular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on\nbibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick\nlook-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy\nin my office at work).\n\n   ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...\n\nSo far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title\n(James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think\nI recall a (older) series under the name \"Harper Commentaries\".  Also\nthere's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on\nthe HC also apply to the HBD.)\n\nMy favorite one-volume commentary is the \"New Jerome Biblical\nCommentary\".

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  ",

    "context": "First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.",

    "context": "The DEA and other organizations would have the American people\nbelieve that we are winning the \"war on drugs\".  I'm going to\ndispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing\nyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions\nI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly\ndemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the\nrise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a\npossible solution to this problem.\n\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\nand pot entitled \"Hello Again, Mary Jane\" which appears in the\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\n\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \"Perhaps\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\n    is out in full force,\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\n    Enforcement Administration.  \"The fact is, they're losing the\n    battle.\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\n\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\ndeceive the public.\n\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\nthe statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\nin its true perspective.\n\nFor those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\nthat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\n\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\nwithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\ngovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\n\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\nout.  They are as follows:\n\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\n\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\n      enforcement.\n\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\n      information should also be a felony.\n\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\n\nI'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\nWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it\nthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,\nI posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my\nassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---\nsomething which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot",

    "context": "About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \nsolutions to it.\n\n\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n\tmeasure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\n\n\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\narea.",

I can tell you that mixing them \nbetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless \nthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one \nbank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that \nthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent \nconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit \nnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte \n).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent \nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry \nif too techie for ya].\n\n\nMG>> \tSimilarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to \ngi\nMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports\nMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my\nMG>> 16MB ??\n\nThat sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit \nwide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  \nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \none SIMM at a time.\n\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \nquestion was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'\n\n-rdd    \n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

The fact that some groups try to read \n     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For \n     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \n     on the Deity of Christ.\n\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \n     have differing views is self-defeating.

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\nOne of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was\nthe Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just\nbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed\nseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the\nNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last\nyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the\nranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing\ncriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I\nscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\n\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\nmore closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell\nanything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you\ndon't also understand the scoring.",

    "context": "Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or\na tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can\nnever be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to\nthis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He\ndesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If\nthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this\ncup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and\nwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.\nIs Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification\nwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept\nJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on\nthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people\nexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what\nkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different\nworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age\ncould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on\nthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would\nhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to\nlive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to\nwait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized\nand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his\nreturn.  It's been almost 2000 years.\n\nMike\n\n\n\nAnd the two simplest refutations are these:\n\n(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.\nI have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that\nthe recorded \"impact\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other\ncontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain\nbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection\nis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years\nafter the supposed event.\n\n(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no\none knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely\nexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).\nDon't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one\ngospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make\nup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does\nrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really\nguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.",

These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together \"with good will on both sides\", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer.

If reposting an article\n\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\n\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\n\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\nonly get \"I don't like what that user is doing because...\".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\n\n\tA. J.

    "context": "Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine \"Morning Star\".\n\nHope you like it.\n\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\n\n\n\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\trest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n\t\t\t\t   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\tMaria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\ttwice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\tlived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\n    handkerchief,\"  as\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\ttouch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\t\"No I\n    will  not,\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa\ton  the  landing  brought  the\tattention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\taway.\n    As\tthe  ambulance\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\n    Communion\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\n\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\tus  to\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\n\n\n    by Brendan Arthur\n",
