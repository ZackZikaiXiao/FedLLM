The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\npolice.\"2\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\n \n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\n1986\n-------\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

[*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope\nof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I'm\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\nalready skewed?\n\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\n\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n",

At that village, whose name was publicized\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\ncasualties.\n\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\n\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise\nruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\n'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\nof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'\n\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\nconquest of Haifa.\"\n\n\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"",

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n",

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \nof word-based analyses.\n\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\n\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

    "context": "1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\n--------------------------------\nPlayoffs:\n---------\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\n\nBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\nthe rookie goaltender.\n\n\"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\nfun time of the year, and I'm not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.\"\n\nStauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.  The Kings averaged a 2.1 Nielsen rating in the 10 regular\nseason games aired on Channel 5.\n\nAround the NHL:\n---------------\n*San Jose fired Coach George Kingston, who lead the team to a 11-71-2 mark in \ntheir 2nd NHL season.

Archie\n  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the\n  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,\n  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp\n  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows\n  you to retrieve files located this way.\n\nXarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of\nother flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the\nnew features (from the README) follows:\n\n  * Major improvements include:\n    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new\n      features (FWF MultiList widget).\n    - Ability to expand directories in browser.\n    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.\n    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.\n    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable\n      pseudo-weights.\n    - Online help browser.\n    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.\n    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.\n    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.\n\nGeorge",

My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \"schism\"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\nday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope\nhimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.",

    "context": "\n\n \n \n\n\nYour statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\nGerman voters.\n\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\nChancellor.\n\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\n\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\nbegun to decline.\n\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\nparties to work together.\n\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\n\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\n\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\n",

Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive. ",

    "context": "Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other\nthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\nignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\n\nLater,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\ncited passages are:\n\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\nthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\nabout homosexuality.\n\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\nNote that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\nSo it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \nhomosexuality.\n\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\n1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\nprostitute\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\nshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.\n\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\nintercourse with angels.\n\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\nthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\n\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's\nclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\nappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a\nwhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\nother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things\nvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic\noutcome is not very likely...",

The reason for\nthe formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive\ndrugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),\nantipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and\nso on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate\ninto a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the\nserious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have\nleft and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through\nhundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.\n\nIt was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of\nthe above mentioned.\n\nOh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided\nto check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old\nnine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.\n\nI think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it\nbeing moderated...too bad.\n\nOh well, obviously, no one really cares.\n\nBill Claussen\n\n\nWould anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?",

Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic\ntransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were\ncrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty\nof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly\nexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the\nfirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good\nbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \"America on the\nRoad\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \"The Devil\nWagon in God's Country\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or\nJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.\n\nAs to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early\nteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel\non the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the\nright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller\ninstead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I\ndon't know why.\n\n\nDan\ndh3q@andrew.cmu.edu\nCarnegie Mellon University\nApplied History",

Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\n\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\n\n     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\n\n     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\nnot been spanked yet.\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.\n\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they\ncalm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're\nreally young.\n\n     40\n\n     Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\n\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with\nat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.",

    "context": "********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************\n\nWaxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25\")\t\t   $30\n\nBy the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.

No fancy modulation scheme, just\n: wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.\n\n: I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there\n: are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.\n\n: My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver \"back\n: end\" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm\n: particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any\n: current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a\n: normal IF filter can be used?\n\n: Any suggestions?\n\n: John\n\n  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the\n10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.\n\n  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\n\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\n\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\nreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I\ndidn't bother with it.\n\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\nstream is another matter entirely.\n\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\na second.\n\n  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\n\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\npolarized.\n\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can't\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\nyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread\nspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.\nI'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.\n\n73\nGlenn Elmore n6gn",

    "context": "A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning\ncommunicating\nbetween VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at\nthat time\nallowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However,\nduring\nthis process I have come up with new problems.\n\n1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic\nstring. Is\nthis inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS\nor VB?\n\n2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the\nDDE SQL command,\n(provided the above limitation is overcome by using short\nfield and table\nnames) but how is one meant to update a database?\n   a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.\n   b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command\nfrom VB cannot\n      be used because when the macro requests information from\nVB using a\n      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time-\nouts occur.\n      (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access\nto VB channel\n      is initiated, I guess.)\n   c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.\n\n\n   The way I eventually managed to update a database was by\nsending key-\n   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This\ntechnique has\n   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must\nalways be in a\n   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB\nsends.\n\nAre all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect\nassumptions?\nAre there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any\nsigns of an\nODBC driver for Access?",

But giving Joe the benefit of the \n\tdoubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that\n\the didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his\n\tspeed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely\n\tconfused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that\n\tparticular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?\n\tWell, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing\n\tbut it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play \n\tJordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.\n\tYup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm\n\tgoing to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's\n\tgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - \n\tcoming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign \n\tin that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  \n\tIt's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin \n\twas there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  \n\tBTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third \n\tand going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the \n\treplay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a \n\tserious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year \n\tand I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.\n\n\tWell, I'm still hanging in there.\n\n\tGO REDBIRDS!!

Does\nanybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to\ndiscount your rates?

To ease me of the shock, can somebody\nguesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson\nthey only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,\nper annum.",

The\nargument was\n\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\n\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\n\nPete is usually sharper than that.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\n\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC",

The Bible \"ends\"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I've gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God's existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\nin ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming\nto know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And\nthey don't heal. And doctor's don't know why).\nNon-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.\n\nThis stuff is not like Koresh.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the\nNagorno Karabagh region.\n\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\nAzerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a \ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \nwouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \nbad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\n\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they \nsaid, \"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the \npolice, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\nman didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\n\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\nvery tense, be careful.\"\n\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\nshouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\n\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \nbuses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let's go find some other way to get\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\ntake us to Sumgait.\n\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn't go if you gave me a\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they're burning the city and killing the\nArmenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren't any\nArmenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not \nsaying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \nme. I say, \"I'm 47.\" \"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\" I say, \"It \ndepends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\" I look much\nolder than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was\nsilent, too.\n\nWe're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\nthere were no Armenians with us.\n\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \nstreet, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\n\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's \nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak \ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they're not \nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\n\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We're\nAzerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\" \nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \nhome.\n\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store \nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I \nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \ncouldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\n\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \noff Sumgait.\n\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \ntheir gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\nBut I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly \nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\nI can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \nbehind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\n\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around \nthe second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off \nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \ndoing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But \nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\n\n   April 20, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n",

I did\nrespond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a\ncoincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this\nsite to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This\nis a revision of that original response.\n\n\n[this was in response to the claim that \"Rushdie made false statements\nabout the life of Mohammed\", with the disclaimer \"(fiction, I know,\nbut where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this\ndistinction between fiction and \"false statements\"]\n\n\nI had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You\nhave made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the\nbook, which I have raised in the past, in the \"ISLAM: a clearer view\"\nthread as well as the root of the \"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\"\nthread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that\nyou had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before,\nif you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and\nrespond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of\ncourse, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a\nnumber of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book,\nindicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger,\nwho subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book,\nvindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.\n\nSo far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a)\nthe statements you made concerning the book in the \"a clearer view\"\nposting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements\nof fact, for instance \"Rushdie depicts the women of the most\nrespected family in all of Islam as whores\"), and b) your claim (which\nI had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to\ncover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on\ncritical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by\nresponding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a\nparticular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding\npassages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view\nthat \"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\".  This\nview must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone\nto take it seriously.\n\n\nAnd I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my\nhonest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated\n(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion\nthat most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless\npropaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical\ninterpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's\nessays, which is more than my correspondents have done.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\n\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\n\nShaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.\nI've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\n\n- How exactly did they do this?\n\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\nNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\nto be a Turkish Jew.\n\n- How so?\n\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\nYou  can't do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\n\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\nParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\nconsuls took place.\n\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\nconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\n\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\n\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\n\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\ngovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of\nthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\n\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\nfrom Nazi persecution.\n\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\ncouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\nthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\n\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\nsend money and food out of the country.\n\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\nliving in Israel.\n\nYes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\n\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\n\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\n\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\n\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\ncould see the documents.\n\n- What languages are used in the documents?\n\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\n\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\nsomeday will make the effort.\n\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?\n\nRight. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\n\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\nall sorts of political movements.\n\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\nHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A\npamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in\n1992.\n\nSerdar Argic",

I read an\nold report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the\nexternal monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-\nback.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the\nMicron Xceed) ?\n\tAlso which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards\nthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)\nbut are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the\nmonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?\n\nPlease send me e-mail and I'll summarize.\n\nI would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order\ncompanys that sell monitors or cards.\n\nThanks in advance",

After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands \nwere empty of Turks and Kurds. \n\nThe survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and \nKurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated \nby its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against \nhumanity.\n\nx-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide \nagainst the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations \nto the Turks and Kurds.\n\nTurks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine \ntheir own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\nDuring the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the\nunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish\nand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle\nfor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.\n\nToday, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United \nStates and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative \nEvents, be they cultural, political or religious.\n\n\nSerdar Argic",

Under\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\nproliferated.

And now, all the precedents--not only\nlegal, but political:  \"My fellow Americans, we must send our young\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\nMurder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\nprohibition laws.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\nconsumer's guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n",

I have been writting\nreasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return\nin the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that\nupsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events\nin Texas REALLY have me pissed.\n\n-------------------\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApril  20, 1993\nRepresentative Skaggs,\n\nRecently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the\nBureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response\nyou stated that \"Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control\nlegislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.\nMy question to you is, \"what grounds would you use to deny them access to \nfirearms?\"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total\nignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.\nI say this because there are only two possible paths of \"gun control\" which you\ncould have been referencing.\n\nEither:\n1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this\ncase I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of\nthis Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the\n\"cult\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability\nto purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these\nguns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by\nthemselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your\nChurch to be a cult!\n\nThis line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \"thought crimes.\"  You\nand Pat Robertson should really get along.\n\n2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the\n\"cult.\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by\nsome of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh\nillegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest\nlaws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that\nDavid Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted \nhim to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished\nMonday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple\nhundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.\n\nI have heard claims that they were \"stockpiling weapons.\"  Yet considering the\nnumber of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of\nline with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of\nDallas/Ft Worth for alleged \"stockpiling?\"\n\nFace it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that\nhas passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for \"reasonable\"\nrestrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain\n250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They\nare still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR\ndistrict I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I\nhave only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your \"reasonable\"\ngun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you\nrepresenting Sarah Bradys'?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThank You,\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWilliam J.

In your response\nyou stated that \"Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control\nlegislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.\nMy question to you is, \"what grounds would you use to deny them access to \nfirearms?\"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total\nignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.\nI say this because there are only two possible paths of \"gun control\" which you\ncould have been referencing.\n\nEither:\n1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this\ncase I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of\nthis Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the\n\"cult\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability\nto purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these\nguns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by\nthemselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your\nChurch to be a cult!\n\nThis line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \"thought crimes.\"  You\nand Pat Robertson should really get along.\n\n2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the\n\"cult.\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by\nsome of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh\nillegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest\nlaws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that\nDavid Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted \nhim to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished\nMonday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple\nhundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.\n\nI have heard claims that they were \"stockpiling weapons.\"  Yet considering the\nnumber of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of\nline with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of\nDallas/Ft Worth for alleged \"stockpiling?\"\n\nFace it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that\nhas passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for \"reasonable\"\nrestrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain\n250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They\nare still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR\ndistrict I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I\nhave only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your \"reasonable\"\ngun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you\nrepresenting Sarah Bradys'?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThank You,\n\t\t\t\t\tWilliam J. Vojak\n\n---------------------------\n\n                                Bill Vojak\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\n\t\t\t\tNRA, ILA,\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.\n: Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\n: who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\n: God's work?\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic\ncleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very\nact of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to\nboth the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be\nuncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to\nfollow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known. \nDoctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see\nwhy Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors\nconverted from Christianity to Islam.

The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must \t \n\t  live in harmony with these if they don't want a \"stone-age\" country,\n\t  for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues.\n\t\n\t  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan\n\t  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because\n\t  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must\n\t  live with these. But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking\n\t  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people\n\t  you must think twice.....\n\n\t  And i wonder, \"Shoot down turkish planes\" WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot\n\t  the Armenians can't find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned\n\t  countries.....\n\n\n\n",

Free options\n\tThe BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.\n\tAny other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will\n\tbe more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86\n\tis listed below.\n\n\tX386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was\n\tdone by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).\n\tIt supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.\n\tThere are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,\n\tX386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you\n\tdon't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).\n\tX386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).\n\n2.

What is XFree86?\n\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\n\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\n       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\n       distributions.\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\n       cards is now included.\n\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\n\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\n       more information.)\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \n       information).\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\n\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\n       in the source distribution for full details.\n\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\n\n4. What OSs are supported?\n\n    XFree86 supports:\n\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\n\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\n\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\n\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\n\n\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\n\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\n\n\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\n\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\n\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\n\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\n\n5. What video hardware is supported?\n\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\n\n\tTseng ET4000\n\tTseng ET3000\n\tParadise PVGA1\n\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\n\t\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\n\tGenoa GVGA\n\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\n\tATI 18800, 28800\n\n\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\n\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\n\t256 color mode.\n\n\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\n\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\n\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\n\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\n\n\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\n\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\n\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\n\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\n\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\n\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\n\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\n\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\n\tfuture XFree86 releases.\n\n\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\n\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\n\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\n\twork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\n\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\n\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\n\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\n\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\n\n\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\n\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\n\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\n\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\n\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\n\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\n\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\n\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\n\tworking fine on them.\n\n6. What about accelerated boards?\n\n\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\n\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\n\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\n\n\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\n\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\n\n\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\n\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\n\n7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\n\n\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\n\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\n\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\n\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\n\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\n\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\n\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\n\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\n\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\n\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\n\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\n\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\n\n\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\n\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\n\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\n\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\n\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\n\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \n\tlower bound.\n\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\n\n\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\n\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\n\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\n\n\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\n\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\n\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\n\n\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tferkel.ucsb.edu\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\n\t\tstasi.bradley.edu\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/ISC\n\t\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\n\t\ttsx-11.mit.edu\t\t\t- Linux binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\n\t\tagate.berkeley.edu\t\t- 386BSD binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\n\t\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\t\t\t- Mach binaries\n\t\t\tunder /i386\n\n\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\n\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\n\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\n\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\n\tmade when building the distribution.\n\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n11. Installation directories\n\n\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\n\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\n\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\n\n\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\n\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\n\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\n\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\n\n12. Configuration files\n\n\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\n\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\n\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\n\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\n\n\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\n\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\n\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\n\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\n\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\n\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\n\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\n\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\n\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tIf this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \n\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\n\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\n\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\n\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tNOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\n\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\n\t      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\n\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\n\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\n\t      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\n\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\n\t      starting the server in the future.\n\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\n\n\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\n\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\n\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\n\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\n\n15. SVR4\n\tWhy won't my xterm run properly?\n\n\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\n\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\n\tcsh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\n\n\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\n\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\n\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\n\n16. SVR3\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.\n\n17. 386BSD\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\n\n\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\n\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\n\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\n\n\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\n18. Linux\n\n\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\n\tjump libraries installed.\n\n\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\n\n\tIf your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\n\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\n\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\n\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\n\t-pn argument to X386.\n\n\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\n\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\n\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\n\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\n\tstartx won't.\n\n\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\n\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\n\n\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\n\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\n\n19. Mach\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\n\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\n\n\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\n\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\n\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\n\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\n\n20. BSD compatibility library\n\n\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\n\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\n\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\n\tseed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\n\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\n\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\n\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\n\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\n\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\n\n\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\n\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\n\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\n\tsomething like\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\n\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\n\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\n\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\n\tadd 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\n\nXFree86 Contact Information\n\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\n    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:\n\n\tThe original \"gang of four\":\n\t\tDavid Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>\n\t\tGlenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>\n\t\tJim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>\n\t\tDavid Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>\n\n\tThose supporting non-SYSV operating systems:\n\t\tRobert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]\n\t\tRich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]\n\t\tOrest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]\n\n    e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.\n\n\t--------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions,\nespecially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).",

    "context": "Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\n\n\nand \n\n\nActually, if you do further research as to the Greek word \"apacgw,\" you will\nfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, \"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\" He then\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\n\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\n\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.\"\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \nthese issues.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n\t\t\t\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\n\t\t\t\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding",

    "context": "\nThe \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow\" (John 16:12).\n\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\n\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu",

I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---",

Thanks to all of you that\nreplied.\n\n\n\na) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB\n   and EISA version should have no problems.\n \nb) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't\n   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way\n   of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,\n   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages\n   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this\n   problem.\n\nc) FALSE\n\nd) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M\n   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.\n\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\n\n\n\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \n \nb) Dunno.\n\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\n\n\n\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\n   non-interlaced.\n\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\n\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\n\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\n\n\n\na) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\n   to software incompatibility.\n\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\n\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\n\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\n\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\n   the old driver.\n\n\n\na) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\n \nb) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\n   every 20 minutes or so...\n\nc) Depends on many many things.\n\n\n\na) I like it.\n\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\n\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\n\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\n\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation.

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is a product cipher?\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n* What exactly is DES?\n* What is triple DES?\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n* Is DES available in software?\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n* Can DES be used to protect classified information?\n* What are \"ECB\", \"CBC\", \"CFB\", and \"OFB\" encryption?\n\n\n* What is a product cipher?\n\n  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak\n  operations such as substitution, transposition, modular\n  addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key.\"\n\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams.

It\nBM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\n\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nhenrik]\tAgain, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do\nhenrik]\twant them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.\n\nNews reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  \nCAPS don't change facts.\n\nBM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nBM] is a part of it.  \n\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\n\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\n\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \n\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\nBM]  within their borders?  \n\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\n\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\n\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \nhenrik] OCCUR again.\n\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\n\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\n\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \ndo.  \n\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \n\nhenrik]\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\nhenrik]\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \n\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\n\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\n\nhenrik]\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\nhenrik]\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\n\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \n\nhenrik]\t   I will believe it when I see it.\n\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\n\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n\t\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\n\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\n\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\n\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \n\nhenrik]\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \nhenrik]\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \nhenrik]\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\nhenrik]\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\nhenrik]\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\nhenrik]\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\n\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\nhenrik]\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\nhenrik]\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\nhenrik]\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\nreached in this manner.  \n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\n\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\nhenrik]   for it. \n\nIt didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me \nthat if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also\ntalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?\n\nhenrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\nhenrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\nhenrik] The Armenian Massacres.\n\nYou don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'\nYes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.\nLet's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our\nkids will also be hateful.

Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.

Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.

Price: $59;\n\tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\n\tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\n\tequivalent this is to the Mac version.\n\t\n\tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \n\tMagazine (Feb 1991).

Its user interface\n\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n",

I am the administrator\nof csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out\nthe needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which \nincludes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and\nother places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally\ndisabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of\nincident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several\nmonths ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old\nstory, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't\nremember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to\nfind out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted\nhere, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have\nalways been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with \nClipper.\n\nI posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here\nbecause csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account\ncalled 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains\nthe addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory\nBoard, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses\nof other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,\nsecurity, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on\nthis list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information\nfirst-hand.\n\nThe 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is \nnot a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial\ntraffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get\ntraffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.\n\nWhile you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,\nI would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives\nof the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them\nfor what's happened.

    "context": "\nBetween Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man\noccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\nworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\n\n\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\n\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\nthe sense world.\n\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\npeople's ideas of life after death.\n\n\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\nmuch more as well.\n\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\nviews on this subject).\n\n\nThe way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\nteachings today can be received.\n\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\nexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\n\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\n",

They may say they are \"Christian\"\nbut do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells\nyou?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions.\nAnd ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through\nthe grace of God.\n\n\nTo be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the\nvery name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in\nyour heart, what does that say of your belief?\n\n\nWhite supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.\n\n\"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot\n see?\"\n\nWhat does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins\nforgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To\nrepent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it\nagain.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me\nof being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial\nbackground and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this\ncountry.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these\nWhite supremist \"Christians\" as you call them.\n\nAnyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,\nthen their belief is false.  Do you concur?\n \n\nNazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention.\nWhat I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial\nintolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity\nbut I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.\n\n\nNo arguement there.\n\n\nThe only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian\nmay not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they\ndo and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus\nChrist then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins\nand accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are \nNOT Christian.

However, although baseball\n\thas adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic\n\tplayers still labor under the stereotype of being \"fireballs,\n\thot blooded, flashy\".

If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.",

I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he'll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n\nSo far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's\ntrying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern\n\"for now\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\nto him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.\n\nI don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal\nconviction: nobody is \"beyond saving\" except the one we call the \ndevil and his hosts.",

It's kinda hard to justify their use as\na militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n(translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that\nfor it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live\nrequires some sort of launch vehicle . . .",

However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal\nof letting LE wiretap \"terrorists and drug dealers\" is to restrict\nstronger techniques.  \n\nWiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or\n(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be\ntapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption\nclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the\nintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong\nprivacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system\nexpressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The\nmere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.\n\nThe stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping\ncapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic\ncryptography, and only by this restriction.  \"Clipper\" appears to be\nno more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We\nwould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public\nat large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but\nmost people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses\nthe word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.

And the courts are reluctant to annul\nlaw or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other\ngrounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They\ncould levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the\nhands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your\ncase.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most\nlikely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.

    "context": "I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.\na blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics\ncard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...\n\nUnfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing\ntransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any\nideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly\nappreciated.  \n\nOh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so\nI don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a\nway to take advantage of that fact.\n\nThanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,\nyou will have my undying gratitude.\n\n\nSteve Verity\n\n\n\n",

On the\n<-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.\n<\n<No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \"a little bit\n<and an anachronism.\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are\n<an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the \n<people.  These representatives of the people have already decided\n<that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\n<cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \n<interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\n<of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\n<of the people using their power of government.  If this is not\n<how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.\n\nWrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the\npeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are\nthere to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\nand it would fly using the logic above.\n\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis\nis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those\nwho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a\nmajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\nthe hangee.\n\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\nshows how gullible the people have become to \"I am from the government\nand am here to help you sort of line\".  We have been lied to, fed\nhalf truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control\nlaws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on\nforce, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able\nto override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch\nof elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers\nsure as hell didn't, either.\n\n<> Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.  YOU are the only one here claiming that the\n<-> RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated\n<-> militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a \n<-> number of times.  \n<\n<No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\n<organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\n<meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\n<state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\n<to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n<by Hamilton. \n\nYou better read the Senate Subcommitte on the Constitution regarding the\nSecond Amendment, and a linguist's analisys of the Second itself.\nIN the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions.\nAnd yes, I have the above mentioned documents (and more) online.\n",

Perhaps you heard about\nanti-trust in the business world.\n\nSince we are debating the legality of a commercial\ntransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines\nand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\n\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\n\n\n\n\nAgain Adam, the devil is in the details.

My experience tells me that\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\njust being rethorical.\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\nroots, its dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not\npredominant in Palestine in recent history.

However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n\nNow now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough\nbmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise \nrebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well\nexpect the sucker to last 300k miles.\n\n\nEver got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not\npleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos\nand VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.\n\nAs for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.

    "context": "From article <1993Apr16.162950.25849@newsgate.sps.mot.com>, by markm@bigfoot.sps.mot.com (Mark Monninger):\n\n\nA couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards,\nwe sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the\none I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like\nI wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and\nsigned the deal.\n\nNext day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected\nto take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred\nover 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would\nhave to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the\nprice if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for \n6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good\nexample of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too\nbad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would\nno longer be in business.  \n\nThe next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the\nsalesman said was, \"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out\nhow much profit I should make.\"  The deal went through with no problems.",

I was there\nand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's\ngotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting\nstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!\n\nAs for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either\nmakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck \ntowards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't\nstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or \ncommitts a penalty.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's\n    another split-design.

The layout resembles the\n    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each\n    section is on a \"custom telescoping universal mount.\"  Each section\n    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each\n    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).

To\ndraw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in\nNATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires\nno such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence\nNorway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having\nmotorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the\nEEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in\ntelling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note\nthat our own state governments often play with game with the federal\ngovernment, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.\n\n\n\tIt shouldn't.

The criminals\nin our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.\n\n\n\tWe don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really\nis in this country.

We would, however, fight to keep\nthat option open to you.\n\n\n\tThen you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons.\nWelcome to our ranks.

    "context": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.\"\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.",

True,\nCone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,\nthese teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with\nlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas\nJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.\n     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb\npitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a\nchance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no\npitching.  At least, to me.\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\nseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all\nthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.\n     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-\ntime teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results\nI would love to see that.",

    "context": "\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \"The\nEducation of the Human Race\".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.",

I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\none can get too much of a good thing.\n\n\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\nher, necessarily.\n\n\n\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\neaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\nache) would be expected.\n\n\n\n\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.",

It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)\n  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)\n  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles\n  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)\n  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles\n  6. Two timing belts.\n  7. Constant error signals from computer.\n\n  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging\n     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done\n     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because\n     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4\n     weeks to get because it is on national back order. \n\n     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new\n     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.",

My daughter's Christian school sends\nhome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent\nsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a\nnational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made\nto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is\nworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \n\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\nhappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is\ndrawing near. Look up!",

    "context": "Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n-- ",

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to \"have hardware which will blow\nanything else away\", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as \"Bill\" and\nclaims to be the \"MS-iah\".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n\"interpersonal computing\" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \"I\nwant to welcome you to the 'Next World' \".",

But where did that choice come\nfrom?\n\nWe know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a\ntempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,\ninvent, create, call the action what you will, something that God\nhad not given origin to?\n\nAlso, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?\nWe make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me\nas being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like\nsalvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.\n\nAt least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly\ncoupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...\n\nStill, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?

    "context": "\n   The following is from a critique of a \"60 Minutes\" presentation on MSG\n   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\n\n\t\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November\n\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\n\tthe segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\n\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\n\t('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\n\tsick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\n\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\n\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \n\tthose studies are.\n\n\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\n\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\n\tto back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,\n\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\n\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\n\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\n\thumans but on rabbits.\n\n\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\n\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\n\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \n\theadaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably \n\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.'\n\n\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\n\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\n\tremarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\n\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because\n\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's\n\tresearch with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human\n\tyoungsters.\n\n\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's \n\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\n\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \n\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\n\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\n\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\n\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \n\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\n\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\n\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\n\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\n\tfound in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....\n\n\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\n\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific\n\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\n\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\n\n\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\n\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\n\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\n\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\n\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\n\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\n\n\tThat's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\n\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\n\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\n\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\n\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\n\n\tIt's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\n\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\n\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\n\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\n\n\tThat doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number\n\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\n\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\n\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\n\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\n",

When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\nfiltering.",

    "context": "I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107",

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.

Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?

Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?

The most serious is that the\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\nimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\nin Acts 15.)\n\nHowever there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\nissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\nassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\nlive in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.",

    "context": "I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.",

Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President's new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"",

Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\n\n\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\n\t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\n\t\tsome fancy fonts).\n\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\n\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\n\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\n\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \nWhile most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \ntoo small. \n\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\n                         ============================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n                                 Introduction\n\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "context": "\n\nThe argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\nMatthew\". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\nline of descent from David, the king.",

I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.",

It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\nand wants.\n\n\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\n\n\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\n \n\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\n\n\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \nas in error.",

    "context": "\n       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant\nnumbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't\nbelieve you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is\nrelevant.)\n   \n\n       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of\nRKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is\nthat it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.\nIt discriminates against the poor.\n\n       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what\nconditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection\nif you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular\nbasis or have been threatened.)\n\n\n       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among\ngun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\nif you qualify in every way.\n\n\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\na driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. \n\n       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\nfrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\npast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \n\n\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\nas from one country in Europe to another).\n\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \n\n\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \nthe rights of some other group.  \n\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd\nhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's\nrights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\nby one.\n\n\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\n\n\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\nBut currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\n\n\n       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state\nmay enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\n   \n\n       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently\nimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\ndrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is\nnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody\nelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year\nold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.\n\n       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.\n",

Helsingius?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIDENTITY\n========\n\n_____\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\n\n_____\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\n\n_____\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\n\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\n  order that new users are added to the system.\n\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\n  computer receiving mail.\n\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\n\n  Common Suffixes\n  ---------------\n\n  .us    United States\n  .uk    United Kingdom\n  .ca    Canada\n  .fi    Finland\n  .au    Australia\n\n  .edu   university or college\n  .com   commercial organization\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\n  .gov   government\n  .mil   military site\n \n_____\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\n\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\n\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\n\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\n\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\n\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\n  \n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\n  \n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\n  \n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\n\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\n\n_____\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\n\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\n  individual.  \n  \n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\n    in the From: line.\n  \n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \n\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\n    hackers.\n    \n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\n  on the internet:\n\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\n  \n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\n  \n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \n  \n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\n    interpretations at different sites.\n  \n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\n\n_____\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\n\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\n  in privacy.\n\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n=======\n\n_____\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\n\n_____\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\n\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\n  discourages its regulation.\n\n_____\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\n\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\n  \n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\n    possible.\n  \n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\n    prohibitive for casual use.\n\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\n    \n_____\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\n\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\n  without detection.\n\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\n  \n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\n  \n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\n  various reasons:\n  \n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\n    someone else. \n\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\n    many weeks. \n\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \n\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\n    ones.\n\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\n\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\n\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\n  - Make sure to logout always.\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\n  - Avoid password references in email.\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\n    considerate.\n\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \n  passwords.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\n\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\n \n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\n\n  Examples\n  --------\n\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\n\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\n  is completely invisible to them.\n\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\n  from `group' and `other'. \n  \n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\n  is possible:\n\n    ls foo\n\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\n  \n    ls -l foo\n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\n  readable file named `file':\n  \n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n  \n  The following commands fail:\n  \n    ls foo\n    ls -l foo\n  \n\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\n\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\n  machine as the server.\n\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\n  Windows.\n\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\n  \n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \n  \n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \n\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\n  is extremely complex.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\n\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\n\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\n    such as a university. \n  \n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\n    tested legally.\n\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\n    other than the recipient.\n\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\n    overridden.\n\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\n\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\n  policies.''\n\n_____\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\n\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\n\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\n  unpopular opinions.)\n  \n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\n\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\n\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\n    files\n\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\n  guidelines:\n\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\n    communication.\n  - Use a disclaimer.\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\n    proprietary or `internal'.\n\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\n\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\n  ---\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\n\n  /pub/academic/cases\n  ---\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\n    description of the items in the directory.\n\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\n  ---\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\n\n_____\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\n\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \n  \n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\n    `passwd -f').\n   \n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \n    \n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\n    \n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\n    \n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\n    in your home directory.\n    \n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\n\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\n  below.\n\n______\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\n\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\n  extremely strict.\n\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\n  which can potentially be misused.\n\n______\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\n\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\n\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\n  \n______\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\n\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\n  the internet.\n  \n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\n\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\n  unstoppable.\n  \n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\n  years.\n\n\nANONYMITY\n=========\n\n_____\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\n\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \n  \n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\n\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\n\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\n  assurances of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\n\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\n\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\n\n_____\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\n\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n  for the same person for different machine address email\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n  mentioned above.\n\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\n\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\n  \n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\n    implemented yet.\n\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\n\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\n  \n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\n    that goes through them.\n\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \n\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\n    regarding it as illicit use. \n\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\n    server operator by the user.\n\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\n\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\n  before proceeding.\n\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\n  consequences can ensue.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \n  \n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\n    return addresses. \n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\n    unaltered. \n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\n    to a remailer are common.\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\n    the use of passwords.\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\n  \n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\n  \n_____\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\n\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\n  \n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \n\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\n  acceptance of Usenet.\n\n\n* * *",

    "context": "This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \ndoctrine:\n\n\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\n\n\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n",

    "context": "\nThe third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than\nApple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\n\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\n\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\n\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                           |\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\n                                                      |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n     5000/200                                           650\n                              OR\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n        {=}                                             |\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                         +-----+\n      +-----+                                         |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\n         \n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\n   T     -> T connector\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\n   |\n   |\n\nAndy",

This was two weeks to the DAY from\nwhen I called the order in. \n\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \nhas been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \nlot to do with it. \n\n   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn\n\n",

I expect to have roughly 100\npackaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed\ntesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.\n \t\n\tI know for sure that a DIP will not work\n(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).\nGetting a custom-made package is too expensive, so\nI am trying to choose between a flatpak and a\nleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard\nto test since it has to be soldered on to the test\nsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering \nas I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip\ncarrier sockets also have long lead lines and may\nnot work at high speeds.\n \n\tDoes anyone out there have experience/knowledge\nof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/\nnames of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages\nwould help. \n \nP.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit\nof overkill(?)",

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n\tAlso: \n\n\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]\nxtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.\n\n\tA version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool\nis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package \nalso includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] \n\n[some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov), 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?\n\n\tThe solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will\ncause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the\nstring which appears in the window titlebar.\n\tA solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:\n\t\techo \"ESC]2;TEXT^G\"\nwhere ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,\nand ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).\n\n\tHere is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to\nthe current working directory when you change directories:\n\t\talias newcd 'cd \\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\;$cwd^G'\n\n\tThe digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should \nchange only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name \nused in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the \nicon name.\n\n\tNote: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of\nthe local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the\nescape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.\n\n\tNote: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with\na ^V.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?\n\nThe best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file \nctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.\n\nO'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control \nsequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of \nthe book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n\tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\n\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n\tWhen xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \n\tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n\t\t#!/bin/sh\n\t\t# Reset path:\n\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n\t\teval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n\t\txrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n \"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n\tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\n\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\n\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\n\n\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information\non the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is\navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on \nthe R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen \n(anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.\n\n\tYou probably have an extra space after the specification of the first \nitem, like this:\n\tbasic*text.translations:  #override \\\n\tCtrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ \t\n\tCtrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()\n\t\t\t\t\t      ^ extra space\nThe newline after that space is ending the translation definition.\n[Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?\n\n\tOne solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show\nthe time for timezones other than the local one. \n\tAlternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from\nwhich you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\tTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\tTZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \"King_Of_Prussia_PA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?\n\n\tThe xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,\nwhich is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list \nof various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in \nthe monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.\nIf you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, \nyou can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh, \nby sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request\n\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?\nAfter a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no\nother clients are able to connect to it.\n\n\tThe default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)\ndelete \"old\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which \ncontains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \"! -type s\" to\nthe find exclusion in the cron job.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?\n\nThe R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?\n \nMany users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the \nappropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT\ndoesn't do this but there are two different patches available.\n \nThe first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related \nproblems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file\ncontrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .\n \nThe second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys\nand adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and \nType-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in\ncontrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.\n \n[thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]\n\nA set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups\n11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?\n\n\tGenerally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you\nwith the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly \nfrom MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in\nmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?\n\n\tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs. \nintrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building \nyour program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking \nagainst was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\n\tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the \nX11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW\nsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, \nand applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you\nhave seen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\n\n\tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's\nDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware\nthat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster \nand gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\n\t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A\nWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu \n(129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".]\n\tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site\nwhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \n\n\tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the\nlatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file \nxwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and \nnon-availability of dictionary servers. \n\t\n[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels \nMayer) 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\n\n\tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \n\"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X \ndistribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\n\tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by\nindividual authors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?\n\nThe Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the \nprevious release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility \nacross releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, \ndetails are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the \nnetwork also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the \nfile typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.\n\n[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]\n\nThe comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  57)!

    "context": "\nOpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable\ninterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\n\n\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\nshot.\n\n\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\n18 months to 2 years.\n\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities.

You can't wait to buy, but\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\ncommitments.\n\n\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\n\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\nwe know it.\n\nJosh   |:-)\n\n-- \n",

TORTURE.\n\n/* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */\n/* ---------- \"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\" ---------- */\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\n\nNewspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\n\nSubject: Torture\n\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\n\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\nShabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\nme and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\nyourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\n\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\n\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\n\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\n\n(...follow description of tortures....)\n\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\nyou'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\n\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\none can enter the interrogation wing\".",

A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.

I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\njodge and *one* crooked cop?

Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\"\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls.

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.",

    "context": "This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.",

Not only\nwill this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us\nrun speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by\ngetting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the\nadministration realised, would probably scare them shitless.\n\nNow of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol\nfor internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to\ninplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our\nworkstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised,\nwe use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to\ncatch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during\nsilences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end\nbecause any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)\n\nAs for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as\nI get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.\nIt'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :)\n(whether encrypted or not)\n\nYou know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious,\nwhy doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and\nit didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.",

    "context": "I produced an error last week about CHORION:\n\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler",

    "context": "\n\n\n\nAs far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and\nChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\nJesus.\n\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\nDavid Koresh was not.\n\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\n\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\npeople to do bad things. \n\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\n\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and\nnobody else was.",

And the final standings were:\n\n                 W     L    GB\nSt. Louis       93    69    -\nPhiladelphia    92    70    1\nCincinnati      92    70    1\nSan Francisco   90    72    3\n\nNow it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short\nwere really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of\nthe day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which\ntime Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the\nPhillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at\nthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one\nof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of\nthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched\na complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It\nwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the\nyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.\nAlso notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1\nthrough October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than\nthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that\nstretch.\n",

When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In\nmy mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90\nor so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs\noutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in\njunkyards.\n\nI find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the\nMustang for poor brakes in relation to power.

You just never see two cars\nrunning parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.\n\n\nYou're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal\n\nautobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers\nfoot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground\non the identical car in front of you!\n\n\nIf something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much\nover 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much\nsafer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic\nbecause most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading\na book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.\n\nCraig\n\nIt just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody\ndrives that fast, no big deal.

I always\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\nthe problem.\n\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\nAuditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\nauditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's\njob.\n\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets\naway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\n\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\n\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\nconflict of interest.\n\nAs always, my opinions are my own.",

    "context": "\nThat's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.",

Somewhere between 1 out of three and \none out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent \nassault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems\nlike heart attack and stroke.\n\n'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans\nusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some\nmay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in \nusing firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.\n(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, \nbut many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage\nif anything is low.)\n\nAt any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred \nto as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group \ncan be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might \nsupport a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.\n\nCertainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half\nof your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.  \n\n\nPlease provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might \nconvince your local police departments to switch.

Apparently no other\nlegal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things\nstart today.\n\nMore interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen\nWeaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the\ncourthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \"Who stands\ntrial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)\nWeaver?\"  On the evening news she said, \"I am here protesting\nbecause I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\nI thought we all did.\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!\n\nThe news reporter also interviewed some guy named \"Tim\"\nwho refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the\nguy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he\nexpected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.\n\"Tim\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver\nand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop\ntelling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know\nthe finer points of this one.

This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.",

    "context": "\n\nDo you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nIs there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing\nthe mark?\n\n\nAre they clear or do you have doubts?\n\n\nAn important first step; the realization that Paul was human.\n\n\nYes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best,\nvery weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with\nthe Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the\nmessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this\nmarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To\nbe \"weak in the faith\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the\nbest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?\n\n\nLet me make clear that the \"Law\" is none other than the Pentateuch of\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say\nabout the \"Law\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \"Law\" only\napplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \"Law\"?\n\n\nWho acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother\nwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to\nsay?\n\n\nI don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a\nfollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that\nthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?\n\n\nHow Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?\n\n\nWho says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\n\n\nYou're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\nlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever\nconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what\nyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of\nJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?\n\n\nAs Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.\n\n\nWhich is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications\nthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or\nGod of all humankind of all race and sex?\n\n\nThis is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAgain, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law\nwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nYou acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?\nCan you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you \nChristian or Pauline?\n\n\nWhen did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?\n\n\nPlease reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\n\n\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\n\n....\n\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see\nthat there's a big problem.",

    "context": "SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n",
