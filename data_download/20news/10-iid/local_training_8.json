At first, I thought it was the video driver and \n  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most\n  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of\n  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA\n  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.\n  \n  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It\n  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the \n  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed\n  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.\n  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer\n  one.\n  \n\n\n-- \nsignoff",

(I further contend that the amount of money\nbeing spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)\n\n\n       So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some\nof the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only* \nresponsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which\nis to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)\n\n\n       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.\nIn any case, we're talking about *education*.  \n\n\n       Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the\nsituation.\n\n       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing\ndown, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial\ncelebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise\nunemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.\n \n       I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education\nproblems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack\nof money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a \"tax heaven\"\nand our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see\na correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.\nThe average administrator makes two and a half times what the average\nteacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)\nthe Governor is making a concerted effort to create an \"Education crisis\"\nin order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic\nprograms get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)\nwhile schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an\nunwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education\nis *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to\nbut cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children\nthan ugly art.\n\n\n      It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the\nconsent of the governed.  \n\n\n      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of\nbylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions\nhad to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)\n\n\n      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.\nSo what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency\nwith fairly broad powers, including the veto.\n\n\n      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.\nToo much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good\nthing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.\n\n\n      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for\nit.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.\n\n\n       No, if the \"progressives\" don't want the \"reactionaries\" to move\nbackward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of\npeople.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'\nvery effective, especially since it is usually geographically\nconcentrated.\n       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't\nhave to make a better argument than, \"more people than not,\" agree.\n       \n\n       I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)\n       \n       And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.\n       \n       Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer\n\"It isn't democratic,\" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should*\nit be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few\npeople advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of\ndemocracy to bias it against action so much worse?\n",

    "context": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations\n\n\nAVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Hebrew labor\" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement\nfor a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, \"I have no tears for those who\nget rich off of cheap labor\". 2) to furnish an answer to the\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.",

Suggested is an SCSI port for\n  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere's a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\", in\n  \"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)\n--------------------------\n\nA good reference is:\n\n        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F.

Where can I find the geometric data for the:\n================================================\n\na. Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n\"Displays on Display\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \"Jim Blinn's Corner\" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based\n  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,\n  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed\n  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation\n  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).\n  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for\n  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.\n\n  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not\n  be redistributed without permission.\n\n  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that\n  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of\n  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging\n  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.\n\ng. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the \n  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen \n  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many\n  of the more popular image formats.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing",

You might answer that one\ncan't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but\nthat holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has\nthe Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it\nok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other\nmessage that is included as well?\n \n \n(Deletion)\n \nSorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if\none could not have a better system.\n \n(Deletion)\n \nIf we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people\nto kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills\nchildren directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that\nchildren are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?\n \n \nAnd the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important\nin the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it\ncan be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions\nwith that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,\nand have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some\ngod.",

Rather than use technology to accommodate\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\n   commercial use today.\n\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\n   A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n   \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   2\n\n\n   \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\n   in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\n   wiretap.\n\n   The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\n   conversations of Americans.\n\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\n   their findings.\n\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\n   encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n\t     technology to build the National Information\n\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n\t     marketplace; and \n\n\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n\t     high technology products.\n\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   3\n\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n   (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\n   system transmits voice.\n\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\n   protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\n   them from those who break the law.\n\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \n   The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\n   encryption technology are also available.  \n\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n   ---------------------------------\n\n\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\n   A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\n\tconversations of Americans.\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n\tdecipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\n\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n\tescrow system.\n\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\n\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n\thow strong the security is?  \n\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\n\tvulnerabilities.\n\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n\tofficials.\n\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n\tdecisions related to this initiative.\n\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\n\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n\tmanufacturer that produces them.\n\n   Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n\tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n\tto other vendors in the future.\n\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n\tthe \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n\tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n\twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n\tpowerful encryption devices?\n\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n\tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\n\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\n\tdeveloping.\n\n\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n\tAdministration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \n\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\n\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\n\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n\tand terrorism.\n\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n\tthe government hardware?",

Where do they come \n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\n#whatever is societally mandated.\n\nIt's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\n\n#\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\n#>#\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\n#>#\n#>#1)Who is society\n#\n#>Depends on the society.\n#\n#Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?\n\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\nthe rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should\nmake the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,\nbut I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\n\n#\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\n#\n#>Depends.\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\n\nWell, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\n#\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\n#\n#>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions\n#>are none of society's business,\n#\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\n\nBecause sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.\n\n# and only interfering when it's truly\n#>necessary.\n#\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\n\nIMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of\nliar's paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if\nwe don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.\n#\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\n#\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\n\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\n\n#  Thus you\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I've\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \n#\n#I admit I don't understand that statement.\n\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself\ndo it.  Eating meat, for example.",

That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,",

    "context": "After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to\nadd.\n\n\tFirst, most of the people I know who activly use encryption\nprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,\nand any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\ndegree.\n\n\n\t\t\tSincerly,\n\n\t\t\tTim Scanlon\n\n-- ",

    "context": "\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.",

The AT&T Long Distance network has\naround 20,000 T3 trunks (45 Mbit/sec), which is on the order of 10**12 bits/sec.\nThat doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies,\nor our long-distance competitors.  It's about 200 Exabytes tapes / second,\nwhich is pretty large even for the NSA :-)\n\nOn the other hand, I can easily see them recording the traffic for\n\"interesting\" people, such as dissidents, suspected criminals,\nforeign telephone calls, and anybody noticed using encryption.\nAs Ken Shiriff speculates, recording encrypted traffic will probably\nbe judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon ....",

In spite of your false assertion to the\ncontrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual\ncitizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.\n\nAnd, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,\nasserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally\ndistributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.\n\n(And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)\n\nharryb%phred@data-io.com\nphred!harryb@data-io.com\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest\nreason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is,\nas a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Thomas Jefferson",

    "context": "Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for\nWindows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\n\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\n\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\n\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\n   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\n   of a particular section.",

    "context": "In the April edition of \"One Small Step for a Space Activist\",\nAllen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:\n  \"Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes\n   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)\"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!",

Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\n\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\n\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely\npossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just\nsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to\na Senator...).\n\n\nI don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.\nHowever -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same\nescrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,\nthey can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.\n\nI still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.

    "context": "Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.

I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\nmaking a case for him. \n\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\nbring up his name.\n\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\n\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.",

    "context": "This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\nthe one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\nproposed groups are described below:\n\nNAME: \t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\n\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\n\nNAME:\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\nSTATUS:\t Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\n\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\n\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\n\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\n\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\n\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\n\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\n\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\n\tactual release is slated for May/June '93.\n\n\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\n\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\n\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\n\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\n\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\n\tWindows 3.1.\n\n\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\n\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\n\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\n\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\n\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\n\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\n\n\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\n\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\n\t\n\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\n\twell as Windows 3.1:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\n\t\n\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\n\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\n\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\n\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\n\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\n\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\n\n\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\n\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\n\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\n\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\n\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\n\n\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\n\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \n\nVOTING:\n\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\n\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\n\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.",

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...",

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\n2\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

    "context": "[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\n\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\nhow could it exist before humans?\n\n[deletions]\n\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\n\n\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\n\n\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\nof did It just choose not to?\n\n[deletions]\n\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\nthe explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't\nhelp making a few nitpicks here and there. :->\n\nSincerely,",

The function of this spoof chip is twofold:\n    \n\t1) Transmit Channel\n\n\t    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\n\t    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number\n\t    unrecoverable with just the family key\n\n\t2) Receive Channel\n\n\t    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number\n\t    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the\n\t    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -\n\t    checksums, sequence control, etc.).\n\nThis has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is\na known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits\nas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block\ncan be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed\nFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,\nThe correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits\nof N in E[N; F].\n\nThe one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the\nmutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the\nentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\ncan be recovered are lessened.\n\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\n\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\n\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\nenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state\nfor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.\n\nIt is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\nthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\nand decrypting E(M; K);\n\nThe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including\non the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could\nbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?\n\nSuper encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without\nredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial\nnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should\nnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for\nprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,\nstealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice\nfrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with\na particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and \ndistribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen\nclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not \nsufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.\nThis could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or\nspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted\nstream.\n\nDetection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned\nscheme.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nIf you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use\nthem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid\nlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching\nthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet\ndeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement\nblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\n\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\n\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\ninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's\nsupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to\nthe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants\nan encryption chip with a real time clock?\n\n*****************************************************************************",

That His existence can be proven by reason\nis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \"Traditional Proofs for the \nExistence of God,\" and Summa Theologica).\n\nNow, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,\nI assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen\ncondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?\n\nBecause God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,\nthe Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the\nMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order\nto the universe (logos).\n\nI next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is\ncontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,\nsince God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior\nas early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because\na human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source\nof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.\nThus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.\n\nNow this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim\nis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.\n\nYou next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United\nStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent\ninstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will\nreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,\nand thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For\nexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could\nhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must\nbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. \n\nTherefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.\n\nQED\n \n-- \nboundary",

Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!

And the cases you've cited involve such\nstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are\napplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal\nto the Supreme Court.\n\nWhy can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\nemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\nhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\nsion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\nwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\nvoluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why\nnot; why haven't you?\n\n\tShall I conclude that the point has been received and the\n\topposition has forfeited the field?\n\nWith all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,\nfor your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of\nauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-\nical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.\n\nFor that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would\nbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you\ntold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big\nbanking interests since the 1938 \"admiralty jurisdiction\" coverup thing.\nDo you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble\nto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into\ntheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right\ncombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?\n\nNot only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?\nDidn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US\nofficials to classify you as a \"14th Amendment federal citizen\"?  When\nthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell\nthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,\nD.C., where they belong?\n\nOr maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you\nsuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.\nIf you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just\ndeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads\nwith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet\ncan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with\nplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).\n\nSorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this\ngarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-\ning to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in\njail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.\n\nNeedless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current\nemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to\ncare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a \"14th Amend-\nment federal citizen\", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep\non filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably\nnot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion\nand/or the foreign tax credit).\n",

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency.

But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.",

The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

Roy stood on his head \nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \nend-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \nbecause Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.\n\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \nBellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\nHextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\n\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\n\n\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. \nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\n\n\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\n\nAnd Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because\nthat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,\nwhen you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him\nfor most of the season.\n\n\nThe Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\ncomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \"Burnsian\" hockey to shut\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \nextra 2.\n\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\n\n\nIf you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never\nhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\npuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.",

In addition, it requirs anyone\nwith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the\ntime. \n\nLet me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.\n\nSteve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell\ncars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump\nup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these\nstupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling\nyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing\nto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're\nprotected from doing what you want with your life.\n\nHere's what I see libertarianism offering you:\n\nYour money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.\nIf you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You\ncan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell\nthat car.\n\nYour life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone\nthinks that it's \"wrong\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months\nrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or\ntheir money, it is your life and your money.\n\nMy money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.\nPerhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere\ndissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.\n\nThat someone could go to the government and insist that the government make\nus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing\nwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.\nAnd it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.\n\nThis does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency\nand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.\nAnd yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or\nrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me\nas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.",

However, BIGNUM *is*\n    distributed as part of ecpp (see below).\n\nLenstra's package\n    Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore\n    \n    Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.\n    Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,\n    sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package\n    was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough\n    comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I\n    have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.  \n    I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code \n    looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.\n    Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate\n    storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.\n    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.  \n    Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z\n\nlenstra_3.1\n    Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore\n\n    An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one\n    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned\n    off as an option).

I mention it here because those who have heard\n    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large\n    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer\n    package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.\n    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). \n    Use it only for testing, as it \"may\" expire on a certain date.\n    (I don't know whether this has expired yet.)\n\namp  (Antti's Multiple Precision?)\n    Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi\n\n    Multiple precision integer package in C.

First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today\n[HE]\tFizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)\n[HE]\tare their homeland. Can't you see the\n[HE]\tthe  \"Great Armenia\" dream in this?\n\nGreater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the\nMediterranean, so if you use the term \"Greater Armenia\" use it with care.\n\n[HE]    With facist methods like\n[HE]\tkilling, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the \n[HE]\tblast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to\n[HE]\tescape the from Lacin, a city that was \"given\" to the Kurds\n[HE]\tby the Armenians. \n\nIt has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh \nby removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to \npower last year, he announced he would be be \"swimming in Lake Sevan [in \nArmeniaxn] by July\". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the \nArmenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey \nis going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If \nElchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of \nKelbajar, his people will pay the price. \n\nIt also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they\nare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just \nlook at the situation with the Lezgians.\n\nAbout the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there \nare no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there \nare only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this \"60 \nKurd refugee\" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in \nBaku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border \nwith Iran, and the ridiculous story of the \"intercepting\" of Armenian military \nconversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by \nsomebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed \n\"special correspondent\" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!\n\n[h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane \n[h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one\n[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane\n[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.\n[h]\n\nNo, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.\n\n[HE]\tDon't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes\n[HE]\twere heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities\n[HE]\tannounced that they were going to search these cargo \n[HE]\tplanes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.\n[HE]\t5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of\n[HE]\tof the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not\n[HE]\thumanitarian aid.....\n\nYour \"facts\" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey \nhave been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes\nwere searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments \nwere held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey\nfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was\nconfiscated, other shipments were exchanged with \"crap\" and dirt, then\nshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.\nuses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which\nthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish \nchauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed \nanything other than a paranoid Turkish military. \n\n[HE]\tSearch Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.\n[HE]\tsince it's content is announced to be weapons? \n\nWell, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan\nfrom Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!\n\n[HE]\tTurkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons\n[HE]\tto Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan\n[HE]\tit self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons\n[HE]\tsince it's content is announced to be weapons? \n\nYou are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow\nmoving air transports!\n\n",

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"",

    "context": "Jesus:\n\n\n\n\nBlack and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden\nagenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an\neasy and as straight forward as it reads.\n\nKent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.\nAnd it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.\nMe, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \n\nJesus uses the word \"men\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\nshine light into places inside us where we didn't even know\nexisted. \n\nSo do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,\nwhich do you choose?\n\n\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?

    "context": "I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\non how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\n\n-------\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\nSubject: Clipper Chip\n\n\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\nif I have anything wrong):\n\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \nspecific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\n\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \nproducing\n\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \n\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\n\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\n\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \nNo single person or authority should have the power to\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\n\nMartin Hellman\n\n----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: smb@research.att.com\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\n\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \nif you also post this message with it in which:\n\n1.

The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.\nThe author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \"(at best) \nsecond-hand\".\n\n\t\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching\n\t Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and\n\t he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul,\n\t why are you persecuting Me?\"  And he said, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\"  And\n\t He said, \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\"\n\t\t(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)\n\nPaul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He\nbecame closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were \nfollowers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.\n\n\nI agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you \nthe Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know\nit is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?\n(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)\n\n\nThe Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \nincompleteness of \"inspired by God\".\n\n\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a \nbook written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks \nof life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.\n\n\n\nWhat source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior\nhistoricity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings \nof the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.\n\n\nJesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.\n\n\nPlease rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your\ncurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not\nonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards\nto C.S.

I would\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\nthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\ngoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\nthat helps me.  \n\nI think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\n\nA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what\nI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not\na put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because \nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \ndefinitions and treatments.

    "context": "\n[ -and many others mailed me.  Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to\nme that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]\n\n\n\nYour using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,\nin your termonology, God could not \"cease to exist.\"  However, that is not what\ndeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see\nthat it signifies \"separation.\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \n\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\n\"girlfriend\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\nthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\nthere.  \n\n\n\nWhen I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in\nthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \n\n\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\n\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\nsin.\n\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\ninteresting study, including clh.  \n\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \n\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\nnot.\n\n\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\n\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\n\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\n\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\nis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \n\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\nabsence.\n\n\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\nare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\nunderstanding of Himself.",

If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\n\n\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\ntrouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\n\n\n\nCoffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.\n\n\n\nYou? Nah... \n\nHe was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as\nfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate\nto judge the talent too quickly.

Many sites are listed as\n    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\n    on how to make requests.\n\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\n\n    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is\n    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.\n\n\nVIEWING IMAGES\n\n    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly\n    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To\n    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,\n    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\n    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP\n    sites.\n\n    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image\n    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document\n    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at\n    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory\n    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.\n\n\nONLINE ARCHIVES\n\n    NASA AMES\n\n    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via\n    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and\n    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press\n    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please\n    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.\n\n    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in\n    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the\n    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).\n\n    To access the archives by email, send a letter to\n    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the\n    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:\n\n\tsend SPACE Index\n\tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.\n\n    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in\n    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use\n    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this\n    section for images or programs.\n\n    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image\n    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The\n    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are\n    available in these collections.\n\n    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory\n    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in\n    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is\n    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \"VIEWING IMAGES\" below).\n\n    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to\n    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing\n    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.\n\n    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee\n    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).\n\n\n    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM\n\n    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and\n    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data\n    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140\n    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can\n    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS\n    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,\n    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to\n    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,\n    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.\n\n    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to\n    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and\n    \"QuickStart\" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu\n    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).\n\n    Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).\n\n\n    NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)\n\n    pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by\n    the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status\n    reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions.

The system is specifically designed for\n    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current\n    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and\n    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom\n    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a\n    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA\n    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it\n    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments\n    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered\n    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by\n    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during\n    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop\n    between the user and NASA.\n\n    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs\n    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images\n    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.\n\n    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8\n    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov\n    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the\n    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.\n\n    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in\n    directory SPACELINK.\n\n\n    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)\n\n    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for\n    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.\n    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and\n    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending\n    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.\n\n    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,\n    no parity, one stop). At the \"Enter Number:\" prompt, enter MD and\n    carriage return. When the system responds \"Call Complete,\" enter a few\n    more carriage returns to get the \"Username:\" and log in as 'NODIS' (no\n    password).\n\n    The system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:\n\n\t1   -\tMaster Directory - NASA & Global Change\n\t2   -\tPersonnel Information Management System\n\t3   -\tNimbus-7 GRID TOMS Data\n\t4   -\tInterplanetary Medium Data (OMNI)\n\t5   -\tRequest data and/or information from NSSDC\n\t6   -\tGeophysical Models\n\t7   -\tCANOPUS Newsletter\n\t8   -\tInternational Ultraviolet Explorer Data Request\n\t9   -\tCZCS Browse and Order Utility\n\t10  -\tAstronomical Data Center (ADC)\n\t11  -\tSTEP Bulletin Board Service\n\t12  -\tStandards and Technology Information System\n\t13  -\tPlanetary Science & Magellan Project Information\n\t14  -\tOther Online Data Services at NSSDC\n\t15  -\tCD-ROMS Available at NSSDC\n\n    For users with Internet access, datasets are made available via\n    anonymous FTP once you select the desired datasets from the online\n    catalog. For other users, data may be ordered on CD-ROM and in other\n    formats. Among the many types of data available are Voyager, Magellan,\n    and other planetary images, Earth observation data, and star catalogs.\n    Viewers for Macintosh and IBM systems are also available. As an example\n    of the cost, an 8 CD set of Voyager images is $75. Data may ordered\n    online, by email, or by physical mail.

When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\n\n\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\n(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had\nit so good. \n\n\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\ndoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\ndiscourse about people who \"don't get it\". For those of us in the winning\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \nsuggestion of losing.\n\n\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three\nyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \nweapon of choice these days. \n\t\n\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \nsure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\n\n\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \n\n\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \nminority.\n\n\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care\nwho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\nthe pot.\n\n\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to \nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \nthem be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl\nsomeday)\n\n\n\nBill R.\n\n--",

Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.\nThese people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded\nat first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,\nafter a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,\nthey will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places\nthey can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the\nworld, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their\nsuccesses.\n\nThey will see that there is much much more to the world than just the\nnarrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under\na rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great\n-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.\n\nDo you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm\ngetting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved\nimmesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be\na difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the\nlong hike, but it's well worth it!\n\n\nLook, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?

I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead\nof being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity\ndecided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.\n\n\nNope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling\nthat they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable\nplace, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and\nholy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little\nsheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.\n\nYou may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or\nZen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how\ncan you say you have an open mind?\n\n\nNope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your\nfailures; then you die.

This is in response to a question about\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\n\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\nmention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\n\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\n art thou among women.\"_\n\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\n\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\n\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\nthat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\nof Christ's sinless body\"; she is \"God's Eden, in whom there is\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

On the other hand, I expect him to\nrelease Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\nOtto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\na problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\n\n\nI think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to\ngive him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting\nso gloomy?\n\n\nNo he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when\nthe league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.\n\n\nDon't be so fast.

Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nBM] is a part of it.  \n\nArmenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \ntraining AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\n\t\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT.

That's hard to do when Armenians \nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\n\n\tSo, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\n        wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\n\n\tI will believe it when I see it.\n\n\tNow, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\n        to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n\tDo you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\n\tBARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\n\tBURNING people ALIVE !\n\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nBM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \n\n\tArmenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \n        NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \n\tfrom them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\n\tDon't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\n\tconflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\n\tKARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\n\tAgain, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\n        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\n        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.

    "context": "Hi! Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\n\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\nsummary of the answers).",

Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress.

Better not to give them any ideas, he said.\n\nPretty prescient.\n\nYes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price \nstickers (I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe).",

Your fascist government got away with \nthe genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying \nthe fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away \nwith the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in \nSebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem \ndistricts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed\nand hundreds of civilians also perished.\n\n   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included \n   the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,\n   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, \n   children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians \n   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan \n   districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of\n   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished\n   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to\n   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and\n   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell\n   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims\n   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels\n   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the\n   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from\n   occupying the city.\n\n   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out\n   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the\n   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They\n   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'\n   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.\n\n   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,\n   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible\n   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in\n   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the\n   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.\n\n   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the\n   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four\n   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,\n   they continued to spread death and destruction among the\n   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down\n   their arms. \n\nSource: Uras, Esat: The Armenians in History. Documentary Publications \n(Istanbul), 1988.\n\np. 954.\n\n\"In his speech given at the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal once again drew\n a picture of the  country under occupation:\n\n In the East, the Armenians are making preparations for advancing to the\n River Halys (Kizilirmak), and have already started a policy of massacring\n the Moslem population.\"\n\n\npp. 966-967.\n\n\"The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the\n Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech:\n\n The Armenians in the south, armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the\n protection they enjoyed, molested the Mohammedans of their district.

I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse\nbathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples\nwould come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and\ndivine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize\nthat marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually,\nhowever, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a\nstrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both\nthe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was\nreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no\ngreater moral or religious implications than if I had been\nconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,\nto \"please hurry it up\" may have helped me to this conclusion). \n\n     I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp\ndistinction between marriage before God, and \"marriage\" before\nthe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping\nMatthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business\ndissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it\nassumed jurisdiction nonetheless.  \n\n      I would ask those of you proposing answers to this\nquestion to consider this issue's logical extension: If\nintercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the\nceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes\nmarriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?

    "context": "\n   {Description of \"External Tank\" option for SSF redesign deleted}\n\n\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.",

    "context": "\n\nHere at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film\nsystem (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.\n\nIf you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:\n\nFor the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n",

(then again i tend to be\nsomewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)\n\nthis also relates to the serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" question.  i have\nbeen waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW\ncan we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs\nwe condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things\nfundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be\ntortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and\nkilled?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he\nwould advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them,\nif that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.  \n\ni'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a\ndifferent title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.\n\npeace (shalom),\nvera shanti\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nHand over hand\t\t\t\tnoye@midway.uchicago.edu\nDoesn't seem so much\t\t\t(Vera Noyes)\nHand over hand\t\t\t\t\nIs the strength of the common touch\tdrop me a line if you're in the mood\n\t- Rush, \"Hand Over Fist\"\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[I am also worried about this issue.

There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to\nunsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \"sell now and save on\ntaxes.\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar\nadvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice\nwas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),\nbut merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates\n(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).\n\nIt's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal\neconomic interest.

I'll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \n\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\n\nBK:  \"No.\"\n\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\n\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ",

It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected.

    "context": "Hello src readers,\n\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.",

I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.

Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\nhelped cover it up\"?\n\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.",

Their  daughter  Ruth  married\nWilliam Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of\nLady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their\ndaughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the\neight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady\nDiana.

Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ntoday.\n\n\nSource: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian\narmies in 1914, \"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume\nII: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\"\n(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.\n\n\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city \n of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, \n closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan \n on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized \n and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during \n the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the\n southern side of the lake.\"\n\n\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,\n Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.\n Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First\n World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse\n to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other\n invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian\n success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of\n Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common\n soldiers began deserting in droves.\"\n\n\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of\n World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy\n increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,\n Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn\n massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of\n expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\"\n\nSerdar Argic",

Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.

    "context": "Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part09\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 9: Other Miscellany\n\nThis is the ninth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich",

If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the\n\tcharacters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility\n\tin this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font\n\tfile (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters\n\tappropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.\n\nWell, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.\nAnd in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI\nin Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. \nNo difference there between T1 and TT!   \n\nAnd as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty\nrather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters\nis very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy\nprice in downloading time and printer storage.

So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\ninnocent lives?\n\n\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \ndo it themselves.\n\n\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way\nIsrael is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of \ntolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".\n\nGood lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop\nanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows\nthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and\n'67. Somehow, with that \"limitation\" on the troops \"powers\" I don't\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \"guarantees\" by other parties, the UN is worthless\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \"ruse\"?).\n\n\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\nthe feeling that it is better that \"many of us die fighting\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \naccept our fate.\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\nArab and Islamic groups.\n\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, \"concessions\" gets it NOTHING...except the \nrealization that it has given \"something\" up and now *can only \nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\nstay away from.\n \nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\ndon't be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\npresent-day Arab states)?\n\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \npolicies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \"political factors\"\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\nand most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that\nsort of thing.\n\n\nIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,\nLebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.\nOnce Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain \ncontrol? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.\nTim",

Paul begins\nRomans 14 with \"If someone is weak in the faith ...\" Do you count\nyourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nYes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say?

Perhaps they were \"strong in\nthe faith?\"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.",

It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.

Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?

Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   This attitude\n\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\n\n\n\n    Where is this quote?

Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.

Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.

    "context": "\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\n\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\n\n\n\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.\n\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\nand sensible.\n\n\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\nAs to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\nhas.\n\n\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\n\n\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\n\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\nthey sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true\nsign of weakness.\n\n\nDitto.\n",

Just because one grants the benefits of\nallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without\nregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be \nfree to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  \n(As some/many libertarians would argue.)  \n\nOn a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation\nis obviously worthwhile.

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will\nre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.\n\n#8\tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nNo netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.",

He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "context": "\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).",

Especially when it \ncomes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox\nfan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you\nwith short memories. short lives, or both.  \n\nTo be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism\nfrom those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based\non the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a \nteam, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean\nyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  \n\nYeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.

The whole tenor of this\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized\nrelease' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\nkeys.\n\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\n\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\nover the last decade ofr so.\n\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNSA\n\n\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\n\n\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\nI suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.\n\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\nis blurred yet again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\nword \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\n\n\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \n\n\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\n\n\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\nAfter all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own\nactions.\n\n                                                ^^^^^^^^\n\nAgain, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.\n\n                                                  ^^^^^\n\nAh, so warrents are not always needed it seems.\n\n\nThe ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.\n\n\nNote that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people'\nwill be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.\n\n\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no\ndoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical\npurposes by the middle of the next century.\n\n\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\n\n\nNote we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be\nrephrased as \" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench\nwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.\"\n\n\nThis link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is \na real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please\nexplain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?\n\n\nJust make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.\n\n\nQuick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?\n\n\nThe people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.\n\n\nThe reverse engineering provisions of the 'Mask-work' act could be relevent\nhere.\n\n\nYou don't. Not unless you are one of the 'right people'.\n\n\nThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.\n\n\nI would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),\nless available, and more prone to being comprimised\"\nProofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.\n\n\nThey don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\ngesture.\n\n\nThe 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a\ncriminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non-\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\n\n\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert\nsuitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\n\n\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\nkeys, and the algorithm. Don't think it's at the top of my list of things I must\nhave, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill\nof crock.\n\nAny for any others using it, they must be nuts!\n\nGood luck folks.",

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.",

It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use\nthis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWayne Schellekens\n<schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>",

However, discerning\nexactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so\neasy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should\nbehave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances\nat the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and\ncover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward\nothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived\nfrom absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to\nstrive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world\npeace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)\n \n\nSure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those\ntruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does\npreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal\nclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to\neveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is\nlargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers\nare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is \nwhere scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  \n \n\nGod revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly \nunavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate \ninterpretations.

Well,\nanyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the \nNazis.\n\n \"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously\n  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,\n  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and \n  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\"[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' \n    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.\n  \nAs a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) \nwas the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in\nBoston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but \nhad followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally\nTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\n\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\n  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\"[1]\n\n[1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \"The\n    Armenian Displaced Persons,\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,\n    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.\n\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nSerdar Argic",

First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see\nthe drive there's a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way.

I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat's the moral of this story?

I wouldn't exactly\ncall it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate\nto disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases\nin camera.\n\n\n\nNot Jews. Israeli citizens.

If so, why the big time delay??\nI know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose\nun-important, but I still can't help be curious!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIvan Thomas Barr \n\nContact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk\n\n[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the\nother.",

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.\nNot everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for\nsome reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To\nextend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence\nto beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a\nweapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training\ntime the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years\npracticing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one\n(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would\nhave an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of\ntraining.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.\n\n\nExcellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?\n\n\nTaken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's\nmake it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been\ntaken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,\nassault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted\nmurder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.\n\n\nIn Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered\nyour land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and\nshortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few\nworld wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons\ntend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,\nwere the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or\nwere they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just\nregistering the shotgun?\n\n\n\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not\na homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \"Americans\" first\nand foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,\nwhereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in\nyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother\ntells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke\n\"low Dane,\" whereas others spoke \"high Dane.\"  It was shortly after\nWorld War II, as I remember, that \"low Dane\" was abolished so there was\none common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,\nbecause we have even more obvious means of identifying an \"outsider.\"\n\n\nTake heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.\nAny helpful hints for our educational system?  People have this annoying\ntendency to drop out of school and sell drugs over here.\n\n[ ;-) And what kind of name is Thomas Parsli?

    "context": "\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\n\nMAGI: \n\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.",

What you are saying is\nmore or less heresy.  You might call it \"infallibilism\".  It's the\nidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.\nThis is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.\n\nThe Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and\nwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can\nmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.\n\nA couple historical examples come to mind.\n\nBishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the\nEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning\nPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop\nGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though\nmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even\nwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\n\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to\ndefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic\ndoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\nChurch.\n\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\ninto heresy or schism.",

They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\nWhere are you?\n\n\nSerdar Argic",

Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.",

    "context": "I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash\nsystem as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\n\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\nretrieved from\n\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\n\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\n\n====================================================================\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\nproposed previously.\n  \nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \n  \nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\nretaining its computational efficiency.\n====================================================================\n\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \n\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\nwelcome!\n\nStefan Brands, ",

    "context": "\nAs a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the\n\"innovations\" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return\nto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.\n\nI spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in\nthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\n\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to \nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\nministers.\n\nIn Christ,\nKershner\n-- \nKershner Wyatt\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com",

Libertarians would do well to learn more\n:about it. \n\n\n\nOkay,  let me try to explain this.\n\nWhen one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President,\none votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover\nall issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted.\nI might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations,\nthe vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation,\ncombined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would\nmake it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision\nwith respect to specific regulations.     \n:Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only \"feasible\" approach.

All non-coersive functions should be dealt \nwith privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to\nthe state are the coersive ones.\n\n:Perhaps you have.

Do you seriously\ndispute this?\n\n\n\tI don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring\nunder the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably\nintelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.\nI feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be\nignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.

My\nbrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad\n(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to\nother problems with the relationship).

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\ncan't prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.\n",

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've\nannounced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time\nJesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  \"I tell you the\ntruth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He\nwill do even greater things than these, because I am going to the\nFather.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may\nbring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and\nI will do it.\" (John 14:12-14)\nSo, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,\nthe request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other\nbeings, but from Jesus.  Remember that \"there is one God and one\nmediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as\na ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.\" (1\nTimothy 2:5-6.  Also, \"there have been many of those priests [talking\nabout priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from\ncontinuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a\npermanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who\ncome to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.\"\n(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus\nbeing our mediator rather than any other man.\n\nJoe Fisher",

Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the \nexact transcript of your session in the message.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol\nReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\".

Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\n\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

    "context": "Hi,\n\n   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor\nvoltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx \n260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant?

    "context": "\nDarren> In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find\nDarren> arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess\nDarren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines.\n\nand\n\nDarren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources\nDarren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own\nDarren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.\n\nThe point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.  \nWhile reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin.\nYet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, \ndoes Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nDarren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start\nDarren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nDarren> to cover them up.\n\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\nin their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach,\n\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for \nyourself whether to believe it or not.\"\n\nDarren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not\nDarren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of\nDarren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many\nDarren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though,\nDarren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nDarren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On\nDarren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nAs long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert\nBecker's paperback, \"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason\nin Lutheran theology,\" published by Northwestern Publishing House.\nThis book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University\nof Chicago.",

    "context": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nZionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.",

But the point of my *original* original\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\n\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n",

Remember, if you\nasked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would\nprobably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at\nleast some were able to tolerate it.\n\nYou see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general\nfrenzy.\n\n\nWell, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity\nof the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for\npeople that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems\nfor us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking\nclinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.\n\n\nSo, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a\nwhole room of them?  A whole nation?\n\n\nYes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,\nI think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted\nwith what *could* happen (an what may be likely).\n\n\nWell, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the\nmotto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed\nin a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,\nbut I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively\ndespise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.\n\n\nWell, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think\nthat it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people\n(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their\nfaiths.\n\n\nWell, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to\nget access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help\nout here?\n\n\nOnly in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.\n\n\n\nSo, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?\n\nAnyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto\nsomehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.\n\n\nThat is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of\nthe USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included\nall atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes\n(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.\nThey advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not\nmentioned.\n\n\nSo, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions\nshould be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.\nI think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.\n\n\nI think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight\ncost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by\nbeing on our currency.\n\n\nWell, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it\nshould be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the\nconsequences.\n\n\nThen you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.\n\n\nWhy not?  It is the majority that put it there.\n\n\nBut do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember\nthat some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't\nyou include this in your little survey that you were conducting?\n\n[...]\n\nWhat?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein\nsaid about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a\ngood chance that it was right (at least at the time).\n\n\nYou need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think\nthat their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.\n\n\nNo, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court\nJustice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a\nConstitutional Amendment.\n\nAnd, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be\npresented.\n\n\nYes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don't appreciate mushrooms on\nmy pizza, either.\n\n\nWho was forced to put the motto there?  What do you mean?",

For much\nof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \"When it's time to railroad,\nyou railroad.\"\n\n\n  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.\nHowever, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the\nNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and\nmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be\nshared.\n\n\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\ncan even consider putting up.

(818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright.\"\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.

    "context": "\nA question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a\nphilosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything\nevil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\n\n\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal\ncrossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What\nhistorical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-\ncredit it as well as the Bible has?\n\n\nWell, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God's\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \"A Pilgrim's\nProgress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I\nmay have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of\nmind, something to contemplate.",

A genocide of Armenians took place\nduring peacetime.\n\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's \nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we \nsay, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \ndon't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor's.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still,\nup there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the \nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\nfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\npick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Before\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\n\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\n\n\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\nowners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.\n\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\n\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But \nthey already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't \nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\n\n\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\n\n\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\nWhich means that they really don't have any objective reasons for \nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\n\n\n(\"Hot-livered.\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \"hot-headed.\")\n\n\nTypically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other\npeople are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\npossess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just \"pre-felons\" waiting to\ncommit crimes.\n\n\nI don't understand this sentence.\n\n\nLife isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\nBut pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have\nto do to live in this one.\n\n\nNone of ours, I'm sure.\n\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \ndrive drunk, drive without it!\n\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\n\n\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's\nwhether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.\nI don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.\nI do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning\none, too.\n-- ",

    "context": "(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.\n\n[AFS]     Just a quick comment::\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?\n\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \nrevisionists say!\n\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\n\nOK.\n\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\naway!\n\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \n\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\n\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\n\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> \nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \nMassachusetts. \n\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\n\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \ntoday.\n\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \n[SY] should they become enemies?\n\n",

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",

    "context": "\nWhether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or\ndreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or\nsitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of\nintense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam\nfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming\nup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis\nof the problem first.  \n\nScientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something\nthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,\nbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the \nkey elements in developing it.  \n\nInformal exploration is also often an important element in finding new\nscientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic\nstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the \ntheory of evolution.  \n\nThis is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes\nempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal\nexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation\ndoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical\nstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very\npoor kind of science.  \n\n\nI don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the\nactivities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and\ninformal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

The 1986 Safe\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\nfrom pollution,\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\nexpected to miss the law's deadline.\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\ncalled giardia.\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\nnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary\nsurveys of water systems.\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\nassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately\nput into place programs to protect water sources from\ncontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment\nmust be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted.  \"The time\nhas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop\ndragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from\ncontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs\nneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.\"\n   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\n   Systems EPA Indicates Require Filtration and Do Not Adequately\nProtect Watersheds\n\n CONNECTICUT\n\n Bridgeport            Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.\n\n MASSACHUSETTS\n Boston                H2O Resource Author (MWRA)\n Medford               MWRA-Medford Water Dept\n Melrose               MWRA-Melrose Water Dept\n Hilton                MWRA-Hilton Water Dept\n Needham               MWRA-Needham Water Division\n Newtoncenter          MWRA-Newton Water Dept.\n Marblehead            MWRA-Marblehead Water Dept\n Quincy                MWRA-Quincy Water Dept\n Norwood               MWRA-Norwood Water Dept\n Framingham            MWRA-Framingham Water Div\n Cambridge             MWRA-Cambridge Water Dept\n Canton                MWRA-Canton Water Div-DPW\n Chelsea               MWRA-Chelsea Water Dept\n Everett               MWRA-Everett Water Dept\n Lexington             MWRA-201 Bedford (PUO WRKS)\n Lynn                  MWRA-Lynn Water & Sewer Co\n Malden                MWRA-Malden Water Division\n Revere                MWRA-Revere Water Dept\n Woburn                MWRA-Woburn Water Dept\n Swampscott            MWRA-Swampscott Water Dept\n Saugus                MWRA-Saugus Water Dept\n Somerville            MWRA-Somerville Water Dept\n Stoneman              MWRA-Stoneman Water Dept\n Brookline             MWRA-Brookline Water Dept\n Wakefield             MWRA-Same as Above\n Waltham               MWRA-Waltham Water Division\n Watertown             MWRA-Watertown Water Division\n Weston                MWRA-Weston Water Dept\n Dedham                MWRA-Dedham-Westwood District\n Winchester            MWRA-Winchester Water & Sewer\n Winthrop              MWRA-Winthrop Water Dept\n Boston                MWRA-Boston Water & Sewer Co\n S.
