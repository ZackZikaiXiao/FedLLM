    "context": "I wrote :\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\ntanks\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\ntheir\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\n  ludicrous.\n\nAwesley replied:\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\n\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\nsniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  You continue to\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\ndisputing.\n\nAwesley went on:\n  I\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\n   \n        \"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\n  of the side of the apartment.\"\n  \n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \n\n\"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\n\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\nread\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\n  cities in the Sixties.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\n  guns.\n\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\nbeen *big* news.\n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nAnd on:\n  I don't\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\nactually\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\n  what you find.\n\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\n\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.",

    "context": "GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\n\n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\n\n\n\nI'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\n\n\n\nBrave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one\ndevelops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have\nbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune\nsystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual\ndesensitization.  I now kind of like being called \"anal retentive\" - it has\na nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...\n\n\n\nThanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have\nresearched this area and are lurking in the background will post their\nthoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.\n\nJon Noring\n\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.",

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,\n#>governor Boggs, issued his so-called \"Mormon extermination order.\"  The\n#>only crime (\"illegal activity\") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was\n#>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still\n#>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.\n#>\n#>I guess the Mormons \"got what they deserved,\" because they refused to bow\n#>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This \"disobedience\"\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\n#>their lands and settlements...\n#\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\n#\"average\" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\n\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\n\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\n\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\n#which discourages critical thought.\n\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.\n\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\n#>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\n#for the feds to back off.\n#\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to \"get them thar Mormons\"?  And what about the\n#majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\n ^^^^^^^^\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\n\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\n\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\n\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\n(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\n(paraphrasing) \"all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\nflee to Zion.\"  Zion (the \"pure in heart\") will be re-established in those\ndays, and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...\n\n#>...

Both the\nSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's\ndefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher's rank in \"defense\".  \n\n\tLooking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?

Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  \n\n: \"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\n: now going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nThat was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n   --------------------------------------------------\n  \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\nto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n   --------------------------------------------------\n\n  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\npaying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n\"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\nit in his song \"Black Day in July\".\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\n  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\nmeans I was right.  \n\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\n: been *big* news.\n\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\nneed some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\nwhile.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. \n\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n: it. \n\n   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\nheard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\n\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\nthat they did fire their guns.\n\n   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\nthis far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\naccount I cited.\n\n: --John L.

    "context": "As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager \nI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with \nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\n\n\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n\tcounter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --\n\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about \n1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\n\n\n                 _______________________________\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\n                | |__|\t\t\t   |__| |\n                |_______________________________|\n\n\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't \npin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\".\nI'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\n",

Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \"God Loves You.\"  Isn't\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\n \n \n \n \n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\n \n \n \nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.  For  information\non  how to obtain a copy or to receive a free program guide and list of\nradio  stations on which you can hear our Gospel programs, please write\nto Family Radio, Oakland, California, 94621 (The United States of Amer-\nica), or call 1-800-543-1495.\n \n               ----------------------------------------\n \n \nThe  foregoing  is a copy of the \"Does God Love You?\" tract printed by,\nand available free of charge from, Family Radio.   A  number  of  minor\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\n \n \nI have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a\ncopy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself,\nyou may find the following information helpful:\n \n      title:       1994?\n      author:      Harold Camping\n      publisher:   Vantage Press\n      distributor: Baker and Taylor\n      ISBN:        0-533-10368-1\n \n \nI  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly\nagree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than\never  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts\n20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I\nam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with\nanyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any\nreal  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little\ntime  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

It is most likely that in the\nfuture possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession\nof 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.\nJust like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common\ncomputer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',\nand will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.\n\nThe insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.\nIf the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states\nas far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,\nthe rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far\nbehind - only a few years.\n\nPlease keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens\nones rights in this thing.\n\nFor example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer\nbe private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready\nis very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to\ndecide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes\nguilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The\nphrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it\nto be defined as.\n\nCouple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an\n'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and\nyour past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's\nword as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones\nwith the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't\nthat nice?\n\nWhile the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner\nknows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'\nphone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)\nyou have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has\ngone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they\ncan get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to\na safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:\nRecord everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys\nobtained from the suspect.\n\nThis Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any\npriviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful\npolitical dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.\nAny propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all\nof that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will\nby into this monstrosity.

Madness.\n\n/* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */\n/* ---------- \"From Israeli press. Madness.\" ---------- */\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\n\nPaper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\n\nDate: 19 February 1993\n\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\n\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\nwithin the occupied territories.\n\nExcerpts from the article:\n\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\nway or another insane\".\n\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\n\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\ncalled such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\nkeys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\nthere I become normal.(...)\n\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off\nsomething.\n\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut\nup' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All\nright, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know\nwhat to say.\n\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\nhad hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\nbeasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\nfelt the whole day very badly.\n\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\nGodlike of sorts.\"\n\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why\nshouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\nWhy shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"",

    "context": "Okay, I'll bite. I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...\n\n\nBut didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or\nother? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.\n\n\nWell, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.\n\n\nWell, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.",

The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\nX    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines\nX    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address\nX    above and use the subject 'send rules'.\nX\nX    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:\nX\nX\thost: ftp.uu.net\t(192.48.96.9)\nX\tuser: anonymous\nX\tpass: yourname@yourhost\nX\tdir:  ~/pub/ioccc\nX\nX    As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email\nX    to the above address.

While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design\ncurrently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an\nX-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit\nbudget.  \n\nUnfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the\nvarious X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of\nfrequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and\nthings of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to\nthe server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?\n\nAny and all help would be very appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\n    ---Mark",

I believe the beast is the\nAntichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents\nBabylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some\nviews on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same\nBabylon in as in chapter 17?

The general setup is designed so that when users \n\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)\n\n\tIt seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am\n\tassisting in \"entrapment\" (the users would send thier key anyway\n\tand are not being enticed into doing something they would not\n\totherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?\n\n\tWould the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?\n\nAny answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...\n\njim",

Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\n: the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\n: parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\n: on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\n: over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\n: following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\n: methods?\n:  \nIn fact, that is the reason Easter \"jumps all over the calendar\"- Passsover\nitself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide\npossible span of times.  The few times that Easter does not fall during or\nafter Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox-\nthe beginning of spring.\n\n[more deletions]\n:  \n:       So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\n: goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\n: whore out of the discussion.\n:  \nYour obsession with the term \"whore\" clouds your argument.  \"Whore\" is\na value judgement, not a descriptive term.\n\n[more deletions]\n\nOverall, this argument is an illustration of the \"etymological fallacy\"\n(see J.P. Louw: _Semantics of NT Greek_).  That is the idea that the true\nmeaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact, our\nown experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with\nhow it is _used_, not where it came from.  Very few modern people would\nmake any connection whatsoever between \"Easter\" and \"Ishtar.\"  If Daniel\nSeagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  But that is a highly\nidiosyncratic \"meaning,\" and not one that needs much refutation.",

I also read somewhere that it is next to\nimpossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits\nare nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.\n\n\nOh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is.

How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent\non health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting? \nMaybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.\n\n\nSo what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the\nsecond least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if\nthey didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \"the services they\nexpect from the province just won't be there in a few years\" (Fortunately for\nthem (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the \nCanadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I\nknew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the \ntruth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no \nobligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what\nyou say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling \nsuch basic services, too).\n\n\nWould that it were free.

Does it grow automatically\n: on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?\n\nSome say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of\nthe coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,\nthe property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.\n\n\n:     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not\n: provide us automatically with our needs,\n\nOh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing\nus with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.

Last night, for\nexample, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an\nearlier time, one of them would have been dinner.\n\n: There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to \n: _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it. \n: The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced\n: it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages\n: arrange their affairs.\n\nThe American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often\nfreely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and\nclothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their\nPolynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared\nmany things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \"hi'ipoi\", the Hawaiian\nword for \"cherish\" means \"sharing food\".  The Great Mahele, in which\nthe Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and\nthe poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often\nshare tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village\nand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to\nAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-\ncalled \"theft\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,\nuntil the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.\n\nThese are the people we call \"savages\".\n\nOn the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.\n\nDov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would\nbehoove you to study *all* of the facts.\n",

I seem to recall missing several key parts:\n\t\ta)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting\n\t\t  part comes out.\n\t\tb)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do\n\t\t  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?\n\t2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission\n\t  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?\n\n\t\ta)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?\n\t\t\tThat hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are\n\t\t\ttwounits on the professional handhelds (so no\n\t\t\ttape turnover gaps)?\n\t\tb)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point\n\t\t\tfingers in either direction.\n\n\tAs you well point out, Stephen.\n\n\n\tMore on this below.\n\n\n\tYes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full\n\tpressure of hazard, game playing, and life.\n\n\n\tMore to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended\n\tthat way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --\n\t\ta contradiction in terms.\n\n\n\tTrue.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out\n\tfrom the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.\n\n\n\tThis requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note\n\tthat the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today\n\tis one where the Government:\n\n\t\twants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.\n\n\n\tYes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.\n\tANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves\n\tthe coin.\n\n\n\n\tYah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:\n\n\t\tMoney\n\t\tmade\n\t\tin the image\n\t\tof God\n\n\n\tI wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.\n\tThe onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my\n\texposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney\n\tis:\n\n\t\tI have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.\n\n\n\t25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF\n\thelps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.\n\n\t\tThe reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely\n\t\tstraight on this is that the leaders at press conferences\n\t\thavew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that\n\t\tKoresh or his followers caused this.\n\n\t\tThe BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations\n\t\tand morals (\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\") than they\n\t\tare with:\n\n\t\t\t25 dead children.\n\n\tSame goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.\n\n\n\tMore on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).\n\n\tLook to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever\n\ttoken of objective law and justice a society has had,\n\n\t\tHitlerrs have followed.\n\n\n\tYou do your name sake proud, Stephen.\n\tIts hard, but please keep on keeping on:\n\t\teach voice in the wilderness now will\n\t\tsave a generation unborn from horror\n\n\n\tThe day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this\n\tsociety is the day that society is already beyond redemption\n\n\t\tand that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian\n\t\tbelief aytall.\n\n\t... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the\n\tact that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the\n\twrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or\n\tpunishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to\n\tbe a human society, and become a society of animals.\n\n\t\tWe are _very_ cclose to that.\n\n\n\tSix years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be\n\tpatient.\n\nFor those who like contrary questions:\n\n\tNB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law\n\tofficial hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.\n\tThe official side has its advocates already; lets balance the\n\tequation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake\n\tof an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:\n\n\t\tinnocent until proven guilty.\n\tnot\n\t\tinnocent until presumed guilty.\n\n\t1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.\n\n\t\tDon't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\n\t\tequipment.\n\n\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\n\n\t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\n\t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\n\t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\n\n\t\t\t.... gotcha!\n\n\t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\n\n\t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\n\t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\n\t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\n\t\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\n\n\t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\n\t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\n\t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\n\t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\n\t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\n\t\t  to ignite.\n\n\t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\n\t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\n\n\t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\n\t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\n\t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\n\t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\n\t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\n\t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\n\n\t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\n\t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\n\t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\n\t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\n\t\t\tto the outside?).\n\n\t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\n\t\t\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones\n\t\t\tare missing?\n\n\tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.\n\tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?\n\t\tIN advance of a Court?  God help us.\n\t\t\t(For we are surely not helping ourselves).\n\tYou trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?\n\n\t\tYou are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.\n\t\tLook again.\n\n\tDid it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.\n\t\tAND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.\n\tBut will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance\n\t\tto tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.\n\nNo one wins.  Except:  more force next time.\n\n\tListen to your hearts, people.\n\nThanx again Stephen.\n\nroy andrew crabtree",

    "context": "Michael Bushnell writes;\n\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.\"\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created.\"\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources.\"\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\nproceed from the Father.",

As his guilt has not been established, it is\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\n\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu'min\", which means \"true\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu'min\", or \"true believer\" in\nIslam.",

(Though why this critical\nfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\nIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\nsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\nof the application of any \"critical function\" concerning replication.\nThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \"anything goes\" view.)\n\nTrue, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\nresulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply\ndo not generalize well to the actual history of science.",

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\n\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\ntrachten te verklaren.\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het\nverschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening\n44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de\nABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te\nworden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving\nwordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

I've already pointed out how\nwe aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries\nseldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work..\nTheir attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've\nhistorically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,\nwhile our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the\nEuropean monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite\nlanguage though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and\nthen convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain..\nBut first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to \nrestrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while\nthey forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes\nthese days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to \nconvey... I'm glad my Amer. Hist. teacher was a Libertarian who had us review\na good portion of the Federalist Papers, and debate their origins and meanings.\n\nenough rambling,\n\nJames\n\n",

    "context": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n=============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\n\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n",

If D_K cannot be easily computed\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\n  and Hellman in 1976.\n\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\n\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\n\n* What's RSA?\n\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\n\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\n\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\n\n* Is RSA secure?\n\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\n  results.''\n\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\n\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\n  any case.\n\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\n\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\n\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?",

    "context": "\nI am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\n\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\n\n\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\nor 'difficult'.\n\n\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\n\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\n\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\n\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\n\n\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\n\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\n\n\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\n\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\n:-)\n\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\n\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\netc).\n\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\nisn't too late allready.\n\n\n",

    "context": "The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders\" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are\n    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. \n\n    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results\n    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is\n    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\n    nationwide.\n\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\n    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\n    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\n    Johnston says.\n\n    This type of resurgence \"is possible,\" says Eileen Shiff, author of\n    \"Experts Advise Parents\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\n\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\n    their children.  \"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\" to\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \"lock-in\" party where\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  \"We need to fulfill that parental\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\" she says.\n\n    Officials may \"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't\n    done anything that I've seen,\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\n    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \"there's always going to be\n    experimentation\" with drugs.\n\n    A real war on drugs could be waged \"education-wise,\" she says.  But\n    \"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\n    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible\" through classes,\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\n\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\n    Fla.  \"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think\n    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds\n    (about using drugs),\" he says.\n\n    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only\n    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens\n    with two \"good-looking girls\" in the restroom talking about having\n    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \"That hits home\n    because it's not attractive,\" he says.  \"You can't be doing drugs if\n    you want somebody to like you.\"\n\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot",

Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \nneed to re-boot.\n\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.

Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.

Apparently I  \nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\n\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \n\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\n\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying...

An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\n\nSerdar Argic",

    "context": "{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the\nweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.",

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\nportions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

Not much it seems. \n\n\nIt is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.\nIf only those christian \"scientists\" would take note.\n\n(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian \nscientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly\ntrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified\nby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are \ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \naccounted for. :-] )\n\n\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\nup?\n\n\nMillions of people have \"died for a lie\".  This  point is difficult to \nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\n\n  \nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\nthe claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\".\n\n\n\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\nwas sane....\n\n \n\n\nHmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\n\n\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \n\nTony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\n\n  \n\n\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\nclaiming to be correct.  \n\nIt \n\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\nthan here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments\nof a stranger should be of interest to other people. \n\nSomeone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one\nrules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I\ncould probably find the exact quotation.",

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v",

    "context": "I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. ",

When we clearly recognize pantheism when we \nencounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with \nChristianity and reject what isn't.    \n\nWe need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.

I've\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\nsomething.\n\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\nliving together peacefully.\n\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\n\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\njudgement.",

    "context": "\n   Each chip includes the following components:\n\n      the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n      N, a 30-bit serial number\n      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\nHmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\n\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n   64-bit block R1:\n\n\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\n   agencies.\n\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\nis an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\nchange they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\n\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\nthe back of a napkin.\n\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\ngoal is an illusion of security.\n\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\nby the time we know it may be too late.\n\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\n\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\n\"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\nWe all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\nthis in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\nfor most of the rest of us.\n\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\n   the escrow agencies.\n\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\nhonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they\nhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to\nsteal they keys as they effectively already have them.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com",

The name of the company\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\nof this message on how to contact them).\n\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\n\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\n\n - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\n\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n\n\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n    of the government.\n\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n    changing the keys themselves.\n\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\nHowever he told me a little:\n\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n   secure.\n\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n   the following:\n\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\n\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\n\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n      hardware chip.\n\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\n\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\n\n\n\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.\"   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.\"\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.\"\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.\"\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.\"\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\f\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.\"\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.\"\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.\"\n\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!\"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\f\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!\"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.",

Government of Greece publicly\nencourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places,\nhouses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government\nforces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them.\nYou will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never\nhappen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915.\nThe river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915.\n\n\n\n**Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment\n**directly or indirecly is a \"bad\" person.\n**It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support\n**of the actions of your goverment that make you \"bad\".\n**People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you\n**are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and\n**as a such you must pay the price.\n\n\nYou mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the\ngovernment of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to\nsay Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS\nanywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what\nkind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because\nyou are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.\nMillions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen,\ntheir rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under\nthe Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves\neven though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me\nlaught at you.\n\n\n\n**You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just\n**as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had\n**the luck to be under Turkish occupation.\n**They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.\n**You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about\n**them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.\n\nThe Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against\nTurkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens.\nThey are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to\nkill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known\nby whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape,\ndestroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you\nare not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity.\nYour own government, the Government of Greece actively supports\natrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government.\nPlease Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and\nTurkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of\nthe minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government\ndoes not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric\nactions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and\ntake away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning\nof 21th century???????\n\nAykut Atalay Atakan",

During the famous wars between the \n[DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed \n[DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the \n[DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. \n[DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the \n[DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. \n[DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to \n[DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers \n[DD] there were before the massacre.\n\n[Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760\n\nGood for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri \nsoldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate\nthe area of Armenians!\n\n[Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After\n[Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.\n\nFact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in\n      this seventh century story!\n\nFact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.\n\nFact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there\n      were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and\n      Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon \n      either!\n\nConclusion: Numbers don't lie in either case!\n\n ",

The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom\nof the 13th.  Who won the game?\n\n-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.\n-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent\n defensive plays behind him to do so.\n-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and\n got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of\n the inning.\n\nLooks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for\nthe win.\n\nHow about the offense?\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\n to third when...\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of\n a help, but it was something.\n-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the\n way from first!

I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he'll talk to various\ncolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.\n\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\nme that he just doesn't have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\n\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\n\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\nnow I am afraid to call him.",

Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\".\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or\nnight\" for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God.\"\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I'm mostly playing \"devil's advocate\".  I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.",

    "context": "Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\n\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\ncould just be Ozzie.  The results:\n\n                           RBI-HR\n         Years        Actual   Predicted\nCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6\nClark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6\nMatt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8\nSmith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6\n\nI think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that\nRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall\nand how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.\n\nMore later,\nHarold",

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.",

But there is nothing objective about the\n*process* of science.  \n\nIf good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\nto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\nBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\nis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one\nmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere\ncollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.\n\nExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but\nthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most\nimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  \nWithout this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,\nhypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.\nNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or\nlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really\ngood thinking beforehand.)  \n\nThe difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre\nscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  \nIt depends on the quality of their THINKING.  \n\nIt really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that\nthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical\nstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \n\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.

Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed.

    "context": "   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!",

    "context": "\n\n\n\nWell put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my \nvery soul.\n\nJohn",

    "context": "\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Or am I stuck with\nXPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?\n\nAll help appreciated...thanks!\n\nDerek\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n----------------------- Headers ------------------------\nReceived: from uupsi7 by aolsys.aol.com id aa23625; Wed, 21 Apr 93 23:39:41 EDT\nReceived: from EXPO.LCS.MIT.EDU by uu7.psi.com (5.65b/4.0.071791-PSI/PSINet) via SMTP;\n        id AA16562 for ; Wed, 21 Apr 93 19:44:00 -0400\nReceived: by expo.lcs.mit.edu; Wed, 21 Apr 93 13:58:06 -0400\nReceived: from ENTERPOOP.MIT.EDU by expo.lcs.mit.edu; Wed, 21 Apr 93 13:58:05 -0400\nReceived: by enterpoop.MIT.EDU (5.57/4.7) id AA15705; Wed, 21 Apr 93 13:57:34 -0400\nReceived: from USENET by enterpoop with netnewsfor xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu (xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu);contact usenet@enterpoop if you have questions.\nTo: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu\nDate: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 15:46:20 GMT\nFrom: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk (Derek C.

It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. \n\nYou've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. \nIt cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, \nthe pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. \nThat is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure \nstabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions\n(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make \na non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. \n\nThe Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur\ndoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the \ncleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be \ndone there........\n\n\n\nThe addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it \nlifts off.

    "context": "----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpen letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\n\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n\tcontention.\n\t\n\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\n\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n\t\n\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,\n\tcompared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all\n\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n\t\n\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\n\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide\n\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\n\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\n\t\n\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\n\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\n\t\n\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook's gun\n\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\n\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n\tVancouver.\n\t\n\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n\tthe case.\n\t\n\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\n\tmost factors related to crime control.\n\t\n\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n\tinvolving firearms.\n\t\n\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\n\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\n\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\n\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\n\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\n\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\n\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n\t\n\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\n\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\n\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\n\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tREFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community.\"\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook's gun prevalence index,\" which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver's population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.  From John:\n\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\n            began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\n            world.\"\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\n\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\nwhat His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the\ndarkness of His Passion.\n",

This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.",

It was filed on behalf of about 12,000\nanti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the\nplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.\n     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available\nfor comment on Wednesday.\n     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that\nGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed\nconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.\n     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and\nGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco\nand Los Angeles.\n     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,\nwhich prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.\nIt seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other\nunspecified damages.\n     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the\nplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his\nwife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.\n     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the\nUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence\nMinister.\n     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on\nhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of\nPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.\n     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both\nkept information on thousands of California political activists.\n     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid\nBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and\nBullock received confidential information from the authorities.\n     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and\nGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.\n  REUTER AC KG CM\n\n\n\nAPn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit\n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nBy CATALINA ORTIZ\n Associated Press Writer\n   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the\nAnti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by\nillegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.\n   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to\nuse the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to\nthe class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.\n   \"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate\ncrimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None\nof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\nbecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit\nbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York\nheadquarters.\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\npublic television station KQED.\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\npublic\" from state or federal records.\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San\nFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.\n   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL\ninformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.\nGerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed\ninformation on to Bullock.\n   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.\nBullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit\nbecause he had not yet studied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents",

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal\n(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely\n(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one\nof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\n\n\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n\n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n",

But there is NO evidence - pro or con -\nfor the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to\nsay below on this).\n\n\nSorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a\nconclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God\nis correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence \nof something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something \n(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they \ndisprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never \nseen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \"pink unicorn\" analogy breaks\ndown and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the \nappearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that \n\"pink unicorns\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion\nhas it's foundation in observation and theory. A \"pink unicorn\", if\nit did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.\nThat is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has\nevolved from \"more primitive\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share \na common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however,\nhas no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical\nframe work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM. \n\n\n\n\nI disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as\nexistence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be\ngetting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant\nwe can come back to it. \n\n\nYou are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand\nwhat I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no\ndefinition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of\nanything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate\nto apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you\nthat they can logically prove God or that they have \"evidence\" or ...,\nthen the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).\n\nBTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not\nEVEN wrong. \n\n\nI don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of\nthings that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one\ncannot use observation to infer that \"God does not exist\". Such\na positive assertion requires a leap.  \n\n\n\n\nOnce again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no\nEVIDENCE that \"'god is' is meaningful\" at ANY level. Maybe such\na response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so\nmany people try to run their own private conception of God down\nyour throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and\nonly one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something\nfor which there can in principle be no evidence for or against\nrequires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a\n\"theist\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect -\nbut it must be founded upon honesty. \n\n\n\n",

They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration.\n-------------------------------------------\nDate: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\n\nI just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features\nof Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\non Clipper.\n\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\n\nMartin Hellman had written\n\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\n                producing\n\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nTo which I responded:\n\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n        \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\n\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\nfor the family key SK.\n\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\n        Compute the 64-bit block\n\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\n\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\n        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\nthrown out if desired).\n\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\nfor each value).\n\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\nescrow agencies.\n\nDorothy Denning\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\nwith it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)\n\nI just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical\ndiscussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call\nS1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process\nworking without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the\nSerial-Number.\n\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\n\tGermano Caronni",

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. ",

When looking at the back of\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this\nmethod before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.\n\nLibertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.",

This directory can be used for things like\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\n\nSo, in the future if you're looking for something check there first\nand then ask here.\n\nInstructions:\n\nShort version for techies:\n\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \"type binary\"\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\n\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\n\nLong version for non-techies:\n\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\n\n\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\n\nIf that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\ncommand is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a\nlogin:\n\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\n\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\n\n\tftp\n\nNext you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\n\n\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\n\nI would enter:\n\n\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\n\nYou'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines\nor similar as output:\n\n\tRemote system is UNIX.\n\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\n\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\n\n\tftp> \n\nIf you do not get the line \"Using binary mode to transfer files.\"\nRun the command:\n\n\ttype binary\n\nNow you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\n\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nand\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\n\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\n\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\nthe command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nOnce you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\nanother command.\n\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\nin run the command:\n\n\tls -l\n\nThis will produce something like:\n\ntotal 6021\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\n... and so on ...\n\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n\tget INDEX\nor\n\tget noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n\tTransfer complete.\n\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n\tcd congress/103rd\n\tget HR1025\n\nOnce you're finished you can log off with the command:\n\n\tquit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n\tput file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n\tput whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there'll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll\noverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\n\n\n\n",

We had many of the same prophets, but\nJudaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who\nChristians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing\nin one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity\nand Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views\nand the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each\nreligion.\n\n\nWe are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are\npaid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are\npoor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most\noften goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims\naround the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human\nsense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money\nand nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid\n(and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer\nservices)).\n\nGod's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere,\nGod may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not\nsay for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where\nhe has not/.\n\nThe Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that\nthe Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same\nmessage, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the\nBible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed\ntheir meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the\npersonal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the\nsame language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know\nthat mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed\nto Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which\nwere not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later\nsuch as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.\n\n\nOnly God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if\nthat happens, it was the will of God.\n\nPlease send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what\nyou said.  And yes, may God help us all.",

I can see why\nthey have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft\nsimulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:\n\n(1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group\n    in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.)\n(2) Too many system parameters to take care of. \n(3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes\n    an unpredictable error.\n(4) Group deleting/file deleting\n    After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.\n    But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full\n    of nonsense files.\n(5) share problem\n    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some\n    language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just\n    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to\n    prevent from saving, but not opening.\n\nMicrosoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make \nms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs; \nthe worst thing is they complicate the environment.

A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country...\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year.\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): \"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\"\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid \"people\", right?

Any moron can set\nh_bar = C = 1...\n\n\nOh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist\nPapers?! \n\n    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General\n    Welfare\" clause): \"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n    recital of particulars.\"\n\nBut what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He\nonly wrote it.\n\n\nThat's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist\nPapers. \n\n\nCan't read, huh?  Show me where the document says \"well organized\nmilitia\". \n\n\nThat is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*\nweapon currently in use in the armed forces.\n\n\nBut the major reason is to protect against that very same army.\n\n\n    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: \"This\n    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\n    it.

    "context": "Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\nlife for their children (and themselves).\n\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\nEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \nuntil it was actively sought.\n\n---End serious discussion.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Each report published in the CDC \nSurveillance Summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance \nfindings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions. \n     Summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (March 19, \n1993) issue of the CDC Surveillance Summaries (1) are provided below. All \nsubscribers to MMWR receive the CDC Surveillance Summaries, as well as the \nMMWR Recommendations and Reports, as part of their subscriptions.\n\n SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES\n                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC \n                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 \n\n     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance \nsystems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. \n     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n",

    "context": "\n\nThe Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I'm just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.",

    "context": "\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.",

    "context": "Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.",

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.

Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!

We are quite happy with social \ndemocracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably\nlittle being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by\nsocialism.\n\nThe problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education\nand health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved\nacross the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The\nproblem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.\n\n\n\nEd starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe.

This has meant that the grand coalition between right and\nleft wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The \nmagistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and \ncorruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists\nare in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just\nas baddly.\n\nWhat looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much\nbetter in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going\nto get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people\nwho are free of any hint of corruption.

Radio Atmospheric Science Center.\nIn International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.\nHandbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p\nPublication Date: Jun. 1986\n      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere \ntroposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar \nfeatures an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar.

    "context": "\nEvery city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\nI haven't seen any Glock's). \n\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two\ncents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n\nYes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n\n\nAll common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n\nYeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver\nfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n\nI think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).\n\n\nI have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry\nweapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to\nr.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the\nshooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the\nfire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is\na shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.\n\n\n\n9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still\nlead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the\nstreet cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry\nthe \"Highway Patrolman\".\n\n\nVincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more\nlike $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.",

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\n  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\n  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\n  readers want to see.\n\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\n  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\n  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\n  postings in the right group.\n\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\n  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\n\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\n\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\n\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\n  introductory textbooks.\n\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\n  answered on your own.\n\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\n  in some areas.)\n\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\n\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\n  of this FAQ.",

    "context": "\n\nAndrew,\n\n   How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will\nbe true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a \nmessage -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and\ngiving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some\nof the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to \nwipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and \npunished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like\njews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \"His blood be upon our heads\nand our childrens heads\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to\nthe holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only\nbeen understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly\nthe good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent \nsymbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we\ncannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and\nsay those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a\npoint of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the\nsame legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text.\nUnderstanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test\nall things and hold fast to that which is good. \n\nAt the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think\nthat doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which\nrequires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can\nbe no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider\nJob.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but\ndoubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he \nrebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian\nit to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.",

All\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\n\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\nare essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\n\nThanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\n\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\n\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

There is also an\nautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which\nalso leads to cirrhosis.  \n\nOf course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous\neffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. \nPatients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,\namong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic\ncirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of\nhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. \nThese effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in\nmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for\ncirrhosis is liver transplant.\n\nKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in\nyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the\nsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he\nor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to\nyou, and offer you support.",

In fact,\nwe have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely\nbecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other\nissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the\nsidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just\nwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech\nshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can\nimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority\non a case-by-case basis.\n\nNot so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly\nwhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.\n\nJust as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a\ncase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nThere is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with\nfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a\ngovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an \"efficient\"\nmanner; I call it political market failure.\n\nThus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to\nswallow the \"whole libertarian agenda.\"",

In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:",

Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.\nSo don't write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\n\nDisclaimer number 3:\nI don't speak for Apple, just me.",

(The newest is the T9000\nwhich kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).\n\nAnyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced\nRISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the\nsame \"performance\" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the\nweird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the\nAlpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).\nand in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and\nmake it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though\nyou have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).\n\nIf you can make a \"CISC\" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)\nwith the ideas behind the \"RISC\" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then\nI admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...\n\nIf the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively\nspeaking).\n\nNow I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some\nreal kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...\n\nBut I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna\nstart crying...\n\nbrian\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian \"Hojo\" Lee       | \"Hey, excuse me miss, could I have a .GIF of you?\"\nleebr@ecf.toronto.edu  |\nleebr@eecg.toronto.edu | (try Linux... the best and free UN*X clone!)",

    "context": "[DISCLAIMER: Throughout this post, there are statements and questions which\ncould easily be interpreted as being sarcastic.  They are not.  I have written\nthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling\nto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt to\nfoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no\none, except myself ;-)]\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\n\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\n\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\n\n\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\n\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\n\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\n\tcontent in their ignorance.\n\n\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\n\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\n\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\n\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n\tstructure with biology at the apex).\n\n\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n\tunderlying presuppositions.\n\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n\n\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\n\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\n\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\n\tthat nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\n\n\n\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\n\tWhat do you know of Him?\n",

    "context": "New in this version:  challenge #5, plus an addendum summarizing\nCharley's responses to-date..\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage\n*** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently \n*** specious claims.  I'll continue to re-post periodically until\n*** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them,\n*** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells\n*** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the \n*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss\n*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and \n*** seeming intellectual dishonesty.\n***\n*** This is re-post #3.\n\n\nCharley,\n\nI can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers\nto substantive questions that have been raised in response to your\nprevious posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you\ncannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once\nagain challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for\nyou as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the\nquestions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may\naddress them one at a time for all to see.\n\nShould you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I\nwill re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at\nsuch time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat\nthis procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or\nyou cease to post to this newsgroup.\n\nI would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these\nquestions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be\nkind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too\npleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it\nfrom this list.\n\nNow, to the questions...\n\n1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\nthat you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\natheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\nto do so.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\nstereotype?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \"senses and\nreason are all we have to go by\", and when pressed, you have implied\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\nand reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can\nexperience and interpret it without using senses and inherent\nreasoning?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\n3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by\na.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify\none such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do\nso now.\n\nQuestion: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and\nfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\n\"axioms\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\nthe question.  Please do so now.\n\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\neffect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\nresult in atheism?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n[First quote]\n[Second quote]\n\n\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of \"included\ntext\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't\nrespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify\nthis seeming contradiction.\n\nQuestion:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context\nfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to\navoid \"included text\"?\n\nHere is the context for the question:\n\n\n\nthen later...\n\n\n\nAs usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.\n\n--Dave Wood\n\n\np.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to\nthese challenges to date.\n\n3/18/93\n\n3/31/93 (#1)\n\n3/31/93 (#2)",

I go on living because I _like_\nliving; if I needed any further reason, I'd be free - completely free! -\nto pick any reason that suited me.

    "context": "The story I related is one of the seven apparitions\napproved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happened\nin La Salle, France.\n\nThe moral lesson of the story is:\n\nThe Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has \nbeen used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives\nworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and\nfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we \ndisobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, \nhas been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil\nserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience\nto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   \nThe children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is \nbrought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, \nto obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence \nof The Lamb.\n\nAs she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the\nSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,\nthe Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are \nprotected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new \nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be\nthe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His\nnext coming.\n    \nI relate the story again:\n    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions  \n    in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these      \n    two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot     \n    the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the \n    children that she is afraid she's \"going to lose her\n    Son's arm\".  She is mourning too for these          \n    townfolks because it was their fault that there     \n    would be drought in their harvest; not much good    \n    food again this year as it was last year.           \n                                                        \n    Mary tells the children:                            \n*    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    *\n*    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  *\n*    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           *\n*    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *\n    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.              \n    Then she asked them if they pray.  The children     \n    said \"hardly\".  She asked them to pray every        \n    morning and night.  When the children went back     \n    from work they had to tell somebody about this.     \n    When the news was spred and after thorough          \n*    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        *\n*    were converted and faith and obedience to God       *\n*    were restored in their community.                   *\n\n\nOnce again, the Lamb succeeds.",
