Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban",

It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I\nalso have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16\npacks of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,\n7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color\npens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.\n\n    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for\nHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B\nsized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).\n\n    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at\nleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to\npurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were\nsealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to\nfunction as well.\n\n    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if ",

I developed my own method, which\nrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns\nwhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn\nmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this\nmethod before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.\n\nLi",

Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly.
