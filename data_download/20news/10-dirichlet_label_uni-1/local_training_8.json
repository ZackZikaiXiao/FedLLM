Theories are backed up by evidence,\nbut not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.\n\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\n'best fits' for the data. \n\n\n\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_",

You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ?

I expect to have roughly 100\npackaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed\ntesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.\n \t\n\tI know for sure that a DIP will not work\n(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).\nGetting a custom-made package is too expensive, so\nI am trying to choose between a flatpak and a\nleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard\nto test since it has to be soldered on to the test\nsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering \nas I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip\ncarrier sockets also have long lead lines and may\nnot work at high speeds.\n \n\tDoes anyone out there have experience/knowledge\nof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/\nnames of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages\nwould help. \n \nP.S. The multi-layer fancy GaA",

In the past, God gave us the ability to create\nlife through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life\nthrough in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely \ncosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to\napproach the glory of God.\n  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we\nwill use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality\nunwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!\n  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't\nimpinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the\nspiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and \nlogic, that we begin to interfere with God.",

It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game.
