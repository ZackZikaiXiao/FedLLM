The magnitude of such accelerations he\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g.

I'm pretty much\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\nfrom someone else.\n\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\nThis is because the MPU used \"speed buffering\" instead of having a\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \"speed buffering\"\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\nport board.\n\nHope this helps...\nTom\n",

Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.

Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.

Remember that any interference is\nwasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting\nout in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference\nbetween a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.

The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow a",

This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.

Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nR",
