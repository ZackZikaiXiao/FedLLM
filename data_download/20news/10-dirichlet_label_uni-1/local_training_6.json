Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for\n |some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,\n |etc....  I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.\n |\n |Anyway could me give me some help, please???\n |\n\n\tIn response to a \"different\" kinda wallpaper, here's what I\nuse.  I think the original gif/whatever was called \"not_real\".  The \nartist name and logo is in the lower right corner.  You will need VGA\nI think, and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens.  Use\nthis in your Windows directory and do not tile it.  Hope you enjoy.\n",
