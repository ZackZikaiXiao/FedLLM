What are the advantages of buying a global village\nTeleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc?\n2.  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software.\nWhy are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems\nof Supra?  What kind of incompatibility is it?\n3.  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any\npossibility to add a voice option in the near future?\n4.  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer\nthis coming summer?\n5.  A person did mention a new AT&T modem.  Is it\ngetting good reviews from various Mac Magazines?\n6.  If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and\npossible voice option, what fax modem should I buy?\n\nSorry for posting so many questions, but I think they're necessary.\nI promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder.\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\nRegards",

Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year\ncontract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. \n\nMallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson\n(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for \nthe position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of\nBrown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.\n\nUMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had\nundermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November\nof last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following\nits one year construction deadline. \n\nThe Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this\nupcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994\nseason.
