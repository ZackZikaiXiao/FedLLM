I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the\ncontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.\n\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use\nthis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWayne Schellekens\n<schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>",

There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman.

I think basically the reasoning was that the\ntradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.\nAs the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\nmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\nfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\nSince we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\na predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\nbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelati",

For some\nreason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the\nresurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean\nthe raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:\n\n1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was \npretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right\nnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \"soul\"\n(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?\n\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\np",

A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.

In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under\n 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting.

At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.",
