In comparison Wrigley Field\nin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and\nbundled up fans.  \n\nThe second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!\nI will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.\nIt was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to\nthe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the\nAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,\nbut I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with\na lot of baseball fans in other cities.  \n\nBaseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion\nteams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver\nBronco fans respond. ",

The result,\nwhich they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the\nend of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go\nwrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.\n\n\tNow, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more\nin initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra\non repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car\nneeds repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.\nI would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more\nin repair costs.\n",

Actions\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\n\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\n\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\n\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\nperforming works.\n\n``Not by ",
