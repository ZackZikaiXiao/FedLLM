Most atheists are\nperfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are\nquite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into \nmisunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an\nanalogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan\nWar, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.\n  I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of \nChristianity through argument.

I can spend $250 Max for it,\n\twhat i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter.\n\tOr at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card.\n\tI need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance\n\tincrease i should expect, does the performance increase between the\n\t32 and 64 kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what's the best\n\tprice i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible\n\t$). \n\tI have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu. I don't think it would\n\twork for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed. Do you think i can take the\n\tfpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. Would it work\n\tat 20 Mhz ?. If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?.\n",
