If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No\nteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players\nthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\nin the 1950's for all teams.  \n\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon\nKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with\n38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than\npredicted by Runs Created.\n\n\n",

Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.
