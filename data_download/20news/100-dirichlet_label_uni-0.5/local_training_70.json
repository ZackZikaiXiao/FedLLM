A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\nguaranteed to be mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.",
