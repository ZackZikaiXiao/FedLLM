Now, the problem is that I can't get this mode to work !\nGraphics Workshop 6.1 claims that it can display 24 bit images dithered\ndown to 15 bit colour with my board, but it doesn't work. I have tried\nwriting some assembler code to get the modes working and I have found out\nthat each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ), but only the lower 8 bits\nare considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode, the 640x480 mode refuses to\nwork i.e. remains in text mode ).\nCould someone please help me.",
