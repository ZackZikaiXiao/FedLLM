SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).
