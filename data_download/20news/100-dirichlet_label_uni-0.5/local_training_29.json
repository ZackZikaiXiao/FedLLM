Right now, there\nare mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar\nLake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards\nto the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources\n(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before\nuranium reached $200/lb.\n\n\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\" is nonsense.  Supply and\ndemand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going\nto increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?\nNot bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built\nat a sufficient rate.\n\nUranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or\na project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of\nself-sufficiency.",
