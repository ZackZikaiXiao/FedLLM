It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an\nexcitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate\nis essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain\n(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown\noff.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in\nsmall amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts\nadded by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be\nencountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,\npackaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your\nblood levels so high, that anyone with a sens",

W4WG obviously\nattaches its network drives to \"existing, unused\" drive letters.\n\nI'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on\nmost machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still\nallow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well.",

In\nthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point\nof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\nmay make you headache.\n\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\nit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.\n\nMy experience tells the second method is relible.\n\nHope this helps.",
