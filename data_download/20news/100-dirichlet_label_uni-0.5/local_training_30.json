These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.

The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.
