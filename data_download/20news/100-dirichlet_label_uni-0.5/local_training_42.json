Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects.

The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom\nof the 13th.  Who won the game?\n\n-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.\n-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent\n defensive plays behind him to do so.\n-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and\n got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of\n the inning.\n\nLooks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for\nthe win.\n\nHow about the offense?\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\n to third when...\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.
