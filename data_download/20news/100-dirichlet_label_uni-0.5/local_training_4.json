Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \n\n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind",
