If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\n\n\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no)",
