So Bush\nand the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced\nGrahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush\n\"consented\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending\nincreases.\n\nAs it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps\non spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as\nPresident (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax\nincreases).\n\nThe result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level \nABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.",
