We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality leve",
