A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowe",
