While I have not \nfound it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat. \nIt MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated\nwith pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.  \n   The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return \npolicy.  They extended my \"warranty\" period rather than allow me to return \nthe machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. \nThey encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. \n   Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out\nand I am in less pain.",
