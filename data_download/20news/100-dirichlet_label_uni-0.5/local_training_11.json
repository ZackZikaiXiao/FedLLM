The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent.

We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs.

In many of these cases the defender doesn't even\nhave to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the\ndeterrent that is needed.\n\nI don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the\nright of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent\ncrime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable\nto get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will\nbe able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing\nthe crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling\nguns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic\nincentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns\nshould be banned by the Klintonistas.\n\n\nStatistics, por favor?\n\n\nSee my previous post.
