In terms of laws regarding individual\nrights, restrictions on police searches, etc...

A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies\na doubling in 69/2.7 \\approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people\nseem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,\nfor me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,\nbut large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things\nlike accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,\nand water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's\nrain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than \nthe current government's incompetence for dropping living standards\nin Iran.",
