The topic of conversation\nwas a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park\nwas suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was\noptimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has\nthere been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?\nI know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the\nnew convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be\nnice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave\nthe VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,\nthe Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another\nstory).  I want to see that day!",
