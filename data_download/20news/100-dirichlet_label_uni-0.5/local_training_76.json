The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The\nfoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,\nso there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major\nimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the\nprincip",

Sorry, didn't see that in my copy.\nMost of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of <some dollar\namount> reward for <some simple goal>.  \n\nYou go ahead and do your development, I'll buy off the shelf at higher cost (or\neven Russian; but I also assume that there'd be some \"Buy US\" provos in there)\nand be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little\nitty-bitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun.  And working out the\nbugs of assembly & integration in LEO. \n\nOh, hey, could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment?  I\nwanna do some teleoperated prospecting while I'm up there...\n\n\n",
