I was afraid you would say that!\n\n\nWell, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it\nwould be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at\nleast in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.\n\n\nI can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\ngive him that dreaded \"seasoning\".\n\n\nSorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'\nera.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.\nAny info on that?\n\n\nIn other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind \na different decision than we would make must be financial.
