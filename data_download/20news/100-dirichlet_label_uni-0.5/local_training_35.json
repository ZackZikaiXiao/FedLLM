Recently,\nI switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with \".I\" directives\nthat are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.\nThe resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.\nBack when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords\ndisplayed with underlining....\n\nSo my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under \".I\" directives \nfor nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (\".B\" \ndirectives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit\nthe man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font\nand a bold font, but not an italic font??\n\nAny pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.\nThanks -- John",

I know there\nis an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7\nBut I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.\n\nIs there a color version of MGR for Linux? \nI know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.\n\nDoes anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?\nI can't seem to se",

I'm pretty\nsure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.\nIs xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?\n\nxrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.\n\nI can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc\nand everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a \nsimple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing\nsomething simple here.\n\nComments / suggestions appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance",
