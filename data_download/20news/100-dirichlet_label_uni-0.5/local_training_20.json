At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.",
