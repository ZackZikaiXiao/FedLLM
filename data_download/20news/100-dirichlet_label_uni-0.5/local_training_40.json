For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,\nyou need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific\nimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry\nweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.\nA small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or\nbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be\nthe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within\nthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.\n\nIt sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction\nof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.\nOr, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed\nhere: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year\non the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of\nan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.
