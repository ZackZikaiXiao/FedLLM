From my (atheistic)\npoint of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and\nget some or make some.\n\nNo free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any\nGod can just \"give\" your life meaning, actually. If he\nsays you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose\nif you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But\nI digress...) \n\n\nThis would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric\nendures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like\nit, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should\nendeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say.\nTerrible.\n\n\nProbably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as",
