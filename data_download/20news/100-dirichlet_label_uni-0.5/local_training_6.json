The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the\nright software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. \n\n\nIf you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a\ntime and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer.

But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community.
