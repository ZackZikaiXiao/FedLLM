It does not go into\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\n\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\n---------------------\n\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\n  messages with your private key.\n\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\n  RIPEM) ",

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant?
