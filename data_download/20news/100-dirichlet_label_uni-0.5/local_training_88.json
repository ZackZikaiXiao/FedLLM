Now I would like to display the\nname of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale\nbutton (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays\nthe current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding\nimage file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do\nthe mapping between the scale value and the file name:\n\nXtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);\n\n\nand in the eventhandler do a:\n\n  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))\n   ;\n  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);\n  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/\n\n\nHowever, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co\n   urse\na null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin\n   g wrong?\nOr is the a wrong approach to this problem?\nAny hints are hig",
