Who swings on 3-1 count with Maddux \npitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all \nday.  I also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing.  Watching\nthe Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what\nthe Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does.

I recall, however, near monthly releases of new\nways to \"crack\" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact\nis, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or\nless difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.\n\tI guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to answer.
