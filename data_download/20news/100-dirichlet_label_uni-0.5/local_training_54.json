I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\njodge and *o",
