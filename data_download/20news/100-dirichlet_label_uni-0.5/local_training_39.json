    "context": "I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a \nNuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color \nis possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan\nrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it\ncan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a\nsoftware control panel.\n\n  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw \ncalls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing\nup the mac processor for other tasks. \n\n  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night\nwas $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just\nover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the\noriginal manuals.\n\n  Hurry!",
