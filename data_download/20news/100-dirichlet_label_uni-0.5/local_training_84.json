In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the spe",

There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian).
