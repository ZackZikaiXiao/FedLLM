Spaceflight is NOT in this position.\nThe correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long\ntransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to\nfund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit\nat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.\nBut there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount\nof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.\n  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,\nand large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask\nme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I\ncan't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by\nexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and\nwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industrie",
