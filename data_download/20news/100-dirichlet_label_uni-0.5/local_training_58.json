Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?\n\nAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of\nonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to\n95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar\nwith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not\nbe understanding all of the differences.\n\nIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than\nwith glasses alone.
