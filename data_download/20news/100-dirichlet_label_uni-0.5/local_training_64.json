As much\nas fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning\nthe game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that\nthis is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win\nin any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first\ninstinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch\nit himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.\n\nI enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against \nvisiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the\nfield.\n\nNow, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or\nnot.
