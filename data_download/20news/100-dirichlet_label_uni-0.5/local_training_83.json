The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed th",

The first part of the plan is to begin a \ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \nposed by new technology.\n\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \nby the National Security Agency.

But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\n    nationwide.\n\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\n    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\n    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\n    Johnston says.\n\n   ",
