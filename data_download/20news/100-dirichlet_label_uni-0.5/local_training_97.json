I expect to have roughly 100\npackaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed\ntesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.\n \t\n\tI know for sure that a DIP will not work\n(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).\nGetting a custom-made package is too expensive, so\nI am trying to choose between a flatpak and a\nleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard\nto test since it has to be soldered on to the test\nsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering \nas I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip\ncarrier sockets also have long lead lines and may\nnot work at high speeds.\n \n\tDoes anyone out there have experience/knowledge\nof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/\nnames of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages\nwould help. \n \nP.S. The multi-layer fancy GaA",
