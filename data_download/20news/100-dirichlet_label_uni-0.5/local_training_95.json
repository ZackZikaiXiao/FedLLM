I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various\n   reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.\n   Some of them, yes. Others, no. \n\nI received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on\nthe list, and does not know why he was added.  I'm sure the same\napplies to others on the list.  So, I guess my initial theory was\nright, that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke.  I\nguess I should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy.\n\n\t\tMarc",

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.
