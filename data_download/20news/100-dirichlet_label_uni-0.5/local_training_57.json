For example:\n\n\t(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)\n\nNow, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments\nare passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to\nhow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the\ncode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11",
