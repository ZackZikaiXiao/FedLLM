(Of course, many of those attacking claim that they\naren't Lebanese, so it's not their country.)\n\nGot it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.\n\nCould you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is\npermissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under\nwhat conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves.\nAlso please explain the particular rules that make it okay for\nterrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians,\nbut not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against\nthose missiles.\n",

They\nhave standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes\nunder each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as\nbacklit models.  Some of them can even be cut with scissors\nto form a funky shape other than a rectangle.  Many of the\nmodels are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel,\ncolored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make\nyour own layout.  One piece prices aren't cheap, though,\nas they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45\nfor a 40 position *kit*.\n\nI have no affiliation with Dimolex or any company connected\nwith them.  I *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,\nand am pleased with what I got.",

Are you saying that Indians are\nincapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without\nbeing forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were\ngiven the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the\nCherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy, since they themselves\nowned black slaves.  No, reducing it all to a matter of religion is to\nsupport a much too narrow view of history.",

No one gets killed.\n\nMaybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american\nnapalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.\n\nMaybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they \nmay be thought it was like snifing cocaine.
