If the gift\nof tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,\nno matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the\ngift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to\nhave been written. \n\n\n\nThat's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million\nChristians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory\nfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those\nwho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian\nchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all\nwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  \nI would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges \ndo so more often in private prayer than in public.\n\nLink Hudson",
