Several years ago myself and two others\n#were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5\n#north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our\n#windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the\n#overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and\n#left.\n#A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was\n#in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was\n#a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old\n#that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?\n#I don't think I'll over forget this story.\n#Neil Williams, Boeing Computer Services, Bellevue WA.\n#..\n# \n\n  Neil, what did they do to the 14-year-old who they caught?  What did\n the man's insurance company do?  This could be significant and in any case\n very interesting.\n\n  Followups to alt.parents-tee",

Neither of us have been with other people sexually,\nalthough we have been with each other.  We did not have sexual relations\nuntil we decided to marry eventually.  For financial and distance reasons,\nwe will not be legally married for another year and a half.  Until then,\nI consider myself married for life in God's eyes.  I have faith that we\nhave a strong relationship, and have had for over 4 years, and will be\nfull of joy when we marry in a church.  First, however, we must find a\nchurch( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to\nfind a new church community).\n\nAnyway, I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God, they are\nmarried and are bound by that commitment.\n",
