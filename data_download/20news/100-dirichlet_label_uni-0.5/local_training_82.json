I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\n\nSecond Base:\n\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\nto Cubs...a big edge.\n\nShortstop:\n\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.\n\nThird Base:\n\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\nFlorida.\n\nCatcher: \n\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\nMarlins\n\nLeft Field:\n\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however",

The\nexpected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use\nsome of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to\nmy harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test\nonly slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the\noriginal speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether\nit is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment\nwill be appriciate....\n                                                 Shane Cheney Wang\n",

One set of rules for the Jews (his people)\nand another set for the saved Gentiles (his people).  Why would God\ndiscriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the\nGentile rules.\n\nGod has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the\nlaw.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls\nthe law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can\nnever be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combine\nthe ceremonial and moral laws in one.\n\nIn Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was\nonly saying that for the Jews's benefit.  Your Christ must be a\npolitician, speaking from both sides of His mouth.  As Paul said, \"I have\nnot so learned Christ.\"  Forget all the theology, just do what Jesus says.\n Your excuses will not hold up in",
