If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\nbetween players on different teams.\n\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.

I know if he \ndidn't have baseball, he wouldn't be making near the money he is now.\n\nI just don't understand how some athlete, who only plays a sport for a \nliving for millions of dollars, say he is not being paid enough.\n\nIf nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one hurting.\nThe A's will still win without him.\n\nRemeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic \nability.  NOTHING.  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard working\ncitizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.",

If you read the surrounding passages\nyou would understand what Jesus means by \"life in the world.\"  But\nas is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk,\nand came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly\nwhat Jesus means by eternal life.  \n\nBrian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics\nbook and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding\nmaterial?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus\nmeans by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For\na good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For \neternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that\neternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life\nstarts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship\nwith God.\n\n\n\nIf my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.
