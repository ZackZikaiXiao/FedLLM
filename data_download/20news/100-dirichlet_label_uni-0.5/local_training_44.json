They are largely out of order.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 11, 1992\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\n\n\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\n\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in\nJune.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\n\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\n-------------------------------------------------------------",
