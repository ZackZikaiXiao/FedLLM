Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.

La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!\nAnyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can\nnot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing\neverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.\n\nI am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now\nthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to\npull in\nthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am\nnot sure.\n\nIF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to\ntelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.\n\nThanks in advance\nMerci d'avance\n\nP.S.

I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have\nno right to turn someone else's.\n\n(2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have\nmade His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the\narmy, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.\n\n[B. On the pacifist side:]\n\n(1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army,\nor stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear\nwhether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.\n\n(2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at\ncombatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.\n\n(3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.\nOften it takes decades for the requisite information to become available\nto the general public.",
