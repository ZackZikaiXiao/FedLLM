All that is required is one twenty question\nquiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.\n\n\n      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed\nto drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.\n\n\n       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are\nnot used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do\nso for tax purposes more than anything else.\n    \n\n       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,\nonly make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused \nis not required to have insurance.\n\n\n       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are\nsignificant difference between making rules for *use on public property*\nand *making rules for ownership*.\n\n       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this\nhave been tried in many local jurisdications across the country",
