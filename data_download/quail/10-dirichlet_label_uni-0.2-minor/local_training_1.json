    "context": "I\u2019m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my \u201cbucket list\u201d places \u2013 one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it\u2019s just not my cup of tea.\nFor one thing, I\u2019m not a gambler, like at all. I don\u2019t have anything against it, I just don\u2019t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad \u2013 in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs.\nI wondered how many people do similar things \u2013 gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it\u2019s all OK, but I can\u2019t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that\u2019s for her to decide, not me.\n\nThe juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It\u2019s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I\u2019m the first to say that I\u2019ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I\u2019m not exactly helping to solve the problem.",

He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone.\nThis will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea.\nKim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North\u2019s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North\u2019s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North\u2019s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel.\nIt is unclear if Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.\nSouth Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state.\nThe two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation.\nThe leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the \u201cBridge of No Return\u201d that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.\nMoon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will return to their side of the border for lunch.",

    "context": "I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products!\nOkoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven.\nWhen you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.\nThe first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am also a very trusting person so I decided to give it a go!",

I never really thought anything of it as instructors would often pull guys aside for reviews, specific instructions or taskings.

He was reporting to the commander to let him know whether he wanted to stay in training or leave because the military does not consider a spouse\u2019s pregnancy to be an emergency even though the complication should be. If he were to leave he would have to drop from the TACP pipeline with a possibility of either starting it over from the beginning of quitting all together.\nThe instructor shook his head and I could honestly see it was a difficult task for him to tell the candidate. It\u2019s rare to see an instructor be emotional but it was something that brought reality into the room for us. The candidate was given 24 hours to call the hospital, talk to his wife, learn more of the situation and make a decision. He ended up staying in the pipeline and graduated. His child was born with minor complications but is healthy to this day.\nIt may not be an exact teacher to a student scenario, but it hits pretty damn close to those of us who went through military training.",

Those days where the wind is so strong you can\u2019t instastory for talking (I\u2019m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer \u2018er, not sure\u2019.\nSo I thought I\u2019d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn\u2019t be calling myself a travel blogger.

I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera.\nThis is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be \u2013 and how careful I also am.

The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn\u2019t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I\u2019ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls.\nFor the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better.\nPrior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don\u2019t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I\u2019ve washed it.

I know a realtor I can recommend!\u201d Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well.\nI still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done.

However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he\u2019s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals\u2026and make me out to be a liar!\nAnyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they\u2019ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I\u2019d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it\u2019d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road!\nWhen you\u2019re preparing a lot of food, you\u2019re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn\u2019t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I\u2019d like not having to smell the garbage all the time!",

He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone.\nThis will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea.\nKim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North\u2019s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North\u2019s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North\u2019s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel.\nIt is unclear if Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.\nSouth Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state.\nThe two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation.\nThe leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the \u201cBridge of No Return\u201d that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.\nMoon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will return to their side of the border for lunch.",

    "context": "Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of.\nThe key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality.\nDigging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised.\nA paradigm shift? Not quite\nDoes this study turn on its head \u2018everything we knew about nutrition?\u2019 Not quite. And here\u2019s why.\nBefore the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day.\nHere is just one example \u2013 a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.\nI\u2019m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not. What is of value to look at is the positive messages the study gave and how when you look at the full research field, it takes you back to some pretty sensible advice.",

If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them.\nIn a rush to rid the diet of \u2018toxic sugar\u2019, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact.\nMost recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third.\nThe main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits\u2019 high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.\nEating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits \u2013 in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears \u2013 could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nThe study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.\nIn the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

    "context": "As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \"outdated and unduly harsh\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country\u2019s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\nLast Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations \u2014 more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria apply for sentence commutations.",

    "context": "Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries \u2013 heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food \u2013 has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that\u2019s why it is commonly added in processed foods.\nCombining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.\nTeasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken.\nSalt promotes over-eating\nEleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn\u2019t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.",

The parents  glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly. The kids stared at the floor the whole time. I dropped Mia into a chair at the nurses' station and waited. Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me. I was still waiting for them to figure this out when one of them came over and asked, \"What's the problem?\" \"No problem,\" I said. \"I just want to drop her off.\" We both looked at Mia. A string of drool slowly slipped from her chin to her chest. \"Has she been drinking?\" the nurse asked. \"I'm not really sure,\" I said. The nurse looked back at me. \"You're not really sure? Now what does that mean?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"I found her. I thought maybe I could leave her here.\" \"Sure, we'll just have to fill out the paperwork for that,\" the nurse said. She smiled at the other nurses when she said it, and I couldn't tell if she was joking or not. She had me go through Mia's pockets, but all I could find was a piece of paper with an address written on it. Five Crossings. I couldn't find her ID anywhere. The nurse entered my name and address on a form, then took us down the hall to another room. What seemed like hours later, an old, red-faced doctor finally came in. He glanced at Mia and then washed his hands in the sink. \"You the father or the boyfriend?\" he asked. \"Neither,\" I said. \"I've only just met her.\" I couldn't take my eyes off the garbage can in the corner.

    "context": "One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources.\nSomething I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing.\nAn effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap.\nWhile at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits:\n* Direction \u2013 one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle.\n* Documented commitments are more effective \u2013 a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project.\n* Feeling of success \u2013 regularly revisiting a roadmap and checking off items that have been completed can develop a strong feeling of progress and success. It makes a team feel productive.",

Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck.\nHere is Nalini's review:\nI've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless.\nIn my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit.\nAs a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.",

The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.\nTrump\u2019s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, \u201ca very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.\u201d\nThe U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\u201cIn terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d take it one way or the other. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d see it as negative or positive because they think they\u2019re different from anybody else anyway. They think they\u2019re a very special case,\u201d Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.\nWhile the Iran deal limited that country\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.\nBut apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions.\nJohn Delury, a North Korea analyst with Yonsei University in Seoul, said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is insurmountable but it adds yet another layer of difficulty.\u201d\nIn some ways Pyongyang may be reassured that a deal reached with the Trump administration would likely be supported by the next administration to follow.",

It was top 3 places I had lived in this country.

The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before.

Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.\n\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\" Trump warned the crowd.\nThough Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures.

Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names.\nTrento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones.\nEating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites. Somehow there was always room for dessert, though \u2014 adopted from German and Austrian specialties, you can find cakes like black forest, schwarzplententorte (buckwheat cake, the recipe is below), sachertorte and linzertorte, often lathered with homemade, forest-picked berry jam and whipped cream.",

If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

    "context": "A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys\u2019 restroom next school year.\nThe Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.''\nGrimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys\u2019 restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person\u2019s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies.\nGrimm was born female but identifies as male.\n\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote.\nThe ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nThe issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S.\nThe Obama administration in May directed the nation\u2019s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.\nThe school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.",

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy.\nThis latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA.\nThe U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public.\nThe late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\"\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user \u2014 all without judicial oversight.\nThe FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \"a typo\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \"a very, very big and practical way.\"\nBut a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations.\n\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing \u2018a typo' in the law,\u201d the letter said. \"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online activities without court oversight.\"\nIt was signed by Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and others.",

Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes).

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.\nMiss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \"Well honey? What do you think?\" And I told her: \"I love the little guy.\"\nHe was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man.\nSteve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.",

That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole.

So, yep, I had a heart attack.\nI\u2019m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I\u2019m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse.\nI found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors.\nSince then I find I\u2019m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband.

Call her R.\nR was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories:\nShe wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts.\nShe received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham.\nAt which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome.\nI still feel for her.

No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong.

Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting.

I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should I open it?",

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum\u2019s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of \u201cgreen spaces\u201d such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine.\nIn particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation.\nFor Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli\u2019s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.\u201d\nSacred Landscapes opens on October 10, 2017, at the Getty Museum, where it complements the exhibition Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith in Renaissance Venice.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. \u201cIf our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,\u201d she says, \u201cthe medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.\u201d\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes\u2019 unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including globalization and multiculturalism,\u201d she adds.",

It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California.\nAfter several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila.\nOn the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's.

    "context": "I\u2019ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I\u2019ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\nToday I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag.\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.",

    "context": "If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with \u201cTeen Lab\u201d splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney\u2019s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.",

Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site.

Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that.\nOf course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul.

The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

    "context": "I started reading beauty blogs rather than magazines because I loved their honesty. With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.\nBUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental. I just want to bust out a red pen and edit the post.\nThe carton below, which is floating around Facebook at the moment, was my inspiration for writing this post as it really highlights how, by making the slightest grammatical error, the entire meaning of the sentence changes.\nI suspect that, if you are a similar grammar fanatic, you are sitting here, nodding your head, thinking 'man, that drives me crazy, too!'. If you are not a grammar fanatic then you might be thinking 'hey, what are you whinging about - it is only a couple of letters out of order'. This is why it annoys me so much - I read a sentence but it doesn't quite make sense, so I have to go back and read it again to get an understanding. As soon as I start doing that, I am no longer reading the content of the post but am instead trying to decipher what is being written. As soon as I have stumbled over a few sentences I give up and stop reading.",

For instance, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it\u2019s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or \u201ccomplete physical.\u201d\nLast but not least, blood testing is usually \u2014 although not always \u2014 very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.\nFatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things.\nConfused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more.\nLike much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults.\nHistorically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.\nIn fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)\nThis way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older adults.\nSpecifically, I\u2019ll cover four \u201cpanels\u201d which are commonly ordered, and then I\u2019ll list six more blood tests that I find especially useful.",

Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana.\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.'''\nAlso leading the charge Monday were Trump\u2019s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.''\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \"It's wrong and I hope he stops.''\nBut no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border.\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\nDemocratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \"are just plain despicable.\"\nVela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 \u2014 well before Trump's ancestors.\nVela wrote, \"Mr. Trump you are a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it\u2026.\"\nKasich, Rubio and Collins joined other top Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who all condemned Trump's remarks on Sunday.",

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

    "context": "A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money. That might be the greatest challenge of all.",

    "context": "Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing.\nIt works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn\u2019t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers.\nI have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don\u2019t like this.\nI believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.\nAs such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically \u201cit is my blog and I can run it how I like\u201c.\nThis is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.",

    "context": "U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog.\nUnder U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency.\nIn Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d about it.\nThe financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported.\nThat has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure.\nThe controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances \u2014 his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world.\nHere are six noteworthy takeaways from the report:\nGolf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to $210 million from nearly $300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than $20 million from $14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer.",

Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).",

But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees.\nSo who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others?\nMillions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations.\nIn 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\"\nBy the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013.\nThe remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.\nHowever, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well.\nPresident Barack Obama has set a goal of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees in the 2016 fiscal year, which began on October 1. But the administration is still far behind that schedule.\nAbout 3,500 Syrian refugees have been admitted, leaving about 6,500 spots open with less than four months to go.",

    "context": "WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS \u2014 A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents.\n\"We have a plan to do that,\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning.\nShortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units.\nDavid Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\" he told VOA.\nThe administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts \u2013 that should be the end of the policy,\" Bier added.\nThe moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties.\nNielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act.\n\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\" the secretary said. \"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\"\nThe outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party's conservative and moderate wings.",

And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals with North Korea and Ukraine\u2019s experience in dismantling its nuclear arsenal after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.",

    "context": "Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).",

I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses!

A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset.\nPaul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island.\n\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\" Paul asked.\n\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\" she replied.\n\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\"\n\"You could call it something nice.

Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it\u2019s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don\u2019t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).\nFor some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there.\nOnline tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac.\nIt\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above.

He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it.

Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?",

Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs?\nIt also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin\u2026with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper?\nA Lesson on Creating Self Portraits\nWhether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old\u2019s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.)\nThe teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait.\nGather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it.\nNarrate the process as you walk through the steps.\n\u201cI am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.\u201d\nUse your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

    "context": "Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty\u2019s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his \u201cranch\u201d on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him.\nFollowing a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms\u2014Galleries 105 to 108\u2014share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty\u2019s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place.\nFrom a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa\nGetty bought the 64-acre ranch\u2014once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant\u2014just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (\u201cTeddy\u201d) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection.\nHe knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty\u2019s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)",

    "context": "The pews were packed at First Baptist Church, Coreyville. As part-time music minister of the church, Greg Tenorly sat in his usual place on the podium, behind and slightly to the left of the pastor. He wondered why attendance was up. It was a perfect day--seventy degrees, sunny. That had to be part of the reason. And the sermon title was 'Forgiveness Fighters.' People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage.\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother?\nMaybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened. But he had moved out of the house during his first semester at Lamar University--even though it was only forty minutes away, in Beaumont. A fellow music major had been more than happy to let Greg share the little rent house and the expenses.\nRalph Tenorly had sent his wife to the grocery store for more chips and dip. The big game was already starting, and there were no snacks in the house. But on her way back home, a pickup truck blew through a stop sign, crashing into the driver's side of the car. Barbara was killed instantly.",

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru.\nThe gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions.\nDespite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit.\n\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\" a senior administration official said.\nThe official would not say whether Trump will continue to \"speak his mind\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration.\nTrump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border.\nTrump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall.\nThe disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.\n\nBut Trump will not meet with Cuban leader Raul Castro or anyone from the Venezuelan delegation, White House officials said.\n\"Obviously the Cubans will be participating in the summit, so there will be a mixing of regional leaders, but we don't anticipate at this point a direct meeting between President Trump and Castro.\"",

Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it\u2019s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don\u2019t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).\nFor some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there.\nOnline tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac.\nIt\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above.

Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn\u2019t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes.

Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day.\nAnyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym).

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process.\nSo, our question for today is:\nWhat are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life \u2013 although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life.\nWhat has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, heart diseases, etc.\nThat alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that.\nUnfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. \u2013 basically empty calories.\nObesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole.\nThere is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries \u2013 it\u2019s easier and tastier.",

Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction.\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.\n\nThey also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\"\n\nSome of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.\n\n\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \"without a warrant.\"",

I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results \u2014 absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I\u2019m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field\u2019s The Italian Baker.\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I\u2019m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing \u2014 maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.",

Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW.\nWhile universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980\u2019s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself?\nDavid Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold\u2019s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it\u2019s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.\nTo borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold:\n1. It\u2019s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media.\n2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are.\n3. It\u2019s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.",

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it.

    "context": "But corrected figures, provided by the U.S. military and published Tuesday by SIGAR, suggest that the actual decline was 17,980.\nPentagon officials acknowledged originally providing inaccurate figures to SIGAR because of a failure \"to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army,\" according to a SIGAR statement.\nAccording to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018. That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported.\n\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\" the statement added.\nThe new figures still amount to a sharp decline.\nAfghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified.\nSenior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.\nThose success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nBut the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says.\nTrump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country.\nThe U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to a VOA analysis of monthly data released by the Pentagon.",

    "context": "I\u2019ve often been asked, \u201cWhat is a blog?\u201d This is my attempt to answer that question in a simple way.\nThe word blog is short for web log and although the quick answer for me would be \u201ca web journal\u201d or \u201conline diary,\u201d I think blogs encompass more than that.\nBlogs are platforms for people to write about pretty much anything and everything. I was first introduced to the concept when a few friends starting writing family blogs as a way to keep in touch with distant friends and relatives or keep up with documenting their lives for themselves or their children. Sort of like a modern day scrapbook or baby book.\nThen, I followed a couple friends as they blogged about traveling around America. One\u2019s purpose was to find a small town to settle in and the other\u2019s purpose was to kill time while unemployed and waiting for a call to serve as a minister.\nNow I follow all sorts of blogs. There are blogs about dogs, traveling, kids, cooking, religion, fitness, politics, crafts, parenting, writing, educating, interior design, you name it! There are even blogs about blogging!\nIndividuals run blogs. Groups of friends run blogs. Businesses run blogs. Religious institutions run blogs.\nBlogs are a way for people to connect over certain topics and interests, socializing in the ever-growing blogosphere. Chances are, you\u2019ve read blog posts without even realizing it. Most look like an article you\u2019d find on any website. But blog posts typically have a personal touch.\nThey\u2019re a wonderful way for people to share tips, tricks, tutorials, inspiration, and more with others.\nIf you want a more thorough definition of the term blog, this one is from Wikipedia.\nBlogs are also a way for businesses to advertise through honest reviews and giveaways. They partner up with bloggers to spread the word about their products or services. So, some bloggers are also advertisers.",
