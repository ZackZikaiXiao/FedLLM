I also liked how They made me feel, at peace, and I felt I had the strength to change my own life for the better.\nThey are always there for me.\nHow did you find it?\nWhen I was a teen I heard the word Wicca. I didn\u2019t know what that was. I was curious and decided to investigate it.\nSo, the next day I went to a book store. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on \u201cWicca.\u201d\nShe got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms.\nI mumbled behind the books, \u201cWhich ONE book would you recommend.\u201d\nShe then handed me Scott Cunningham\u2019s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.\nI purchased the book and took it home.\nWith my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book.\nI found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true.\nThe book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book.\nHave you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell?\nI did a prosperity spell once and got the opposite reaction I was hoping for. I lost all my income! I realized later my mistakes and redid the spell correctly and then got the results I truly wanted.",

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.\nMiss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \"Well honey? What do you think?\" And I told her: \"I love the little guy.\"\nHe was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man.\nSteve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.",

When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.\nThe creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \"a local Amiga gaming championship\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest).\nThe school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence.

It\u2019s going to be a multiyear long process,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.\nPresident Trump has said he expects a \"very positive result\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North\u2019s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\"\nThis position aligns closer to the Kim government\u2019s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals with North Korea and Ukraine\u2019s experience in dismantling its nuclear arsenal after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.",

The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.\nTrump\u2019s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, \u201ca very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.\u201d\nThe U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\u201cIn terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d take it one way or the other.

They think they\u2019re a very special case,\u201d Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.\nWhile the Iran deal limited that country\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.\nBut apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions.\nJohn Delury, a North Korea analyst with Yonsei University in Seoul, said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is insurmountable but it adds yet another layer of difficulty.\u201d\nIn some ways Pyongyang may be reassured that a deal reached with the Trump administration would likely be supported by the next administration to follow.",

    "context": "Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we\u2019re inactive until the next day.\nThe reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten.\nThere is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits.\nSo even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn\u2019t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of \u2018normal\u2019 evening eating.\nAdvice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants\u2019 diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period.\nEating at night a waistline hazard\nSo did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.",

The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted.\nI argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly $80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a $10 voucher for my birthday and I got a $30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For $38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite.\nGraphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda?\nI learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the \u201cimpact industry\u201d; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study authors, etc., that have become embedded in the academy.",

On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.\n\nTrump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved.\nThe question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency.\nThat could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish.\n\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal.

I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process.\nSo, our question for today is:\nWhat are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life \u2013 although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life.\nWhat has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, heart diseases, etc.\nThat alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that.\nUnfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. \u2013 basically empty calories.\nObesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole.\nThere is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries \u2013 it\u2019s easier and tastier.",

    "context": "Have you ever wondered whether it\u2019s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising?\nIn 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of \u201csuccessful aging\u201d health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.)\nDuring the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)?\nThat\u2019s right. When it came to avoiding \u201cmajor mobility disability\u201d \u2014 which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more \u2014 a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education.\nSpecifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program.\nThis is a very encouraging finding! That said, it\u2019s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.\nWant to know how often the exercisers experienced \u201cadverse events\u201d? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!)\nLet\u2019s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I\u2019ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers.\nWho were the study volunteers? Whenever you read about a research study, it\u2019s important to understand how the study volunteers compare to the older adults in *your* life. One of the many things I love about this study is that they purposefully enrolled older adults who were sedentary, and physically vulnerable.",

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.",

    "context": "I\u2019ve often been asked, \u201cWhat is a blog?\u201d This is my attempt to answer that question in a simple way.\nThe word blog is short for web log and although the quick answer for me would be \u201ca web journal\u201d or \u201conline diary,\u201d I think blogs encompass more than that.\nBlogs are platforms for people to write about pretty much anything and everything. I was first introduced to the concept when a few friends starting writing family blogs as a way to keep in touch with distant friends and relatives or keep up with documenting their lives for themselves or their children. Sort of like a modern day scrapbook or baby book.\nThen, I followed a couple friends as they blogged about traveling around America. One\u2019s purpose was to find a small town to settle in and the other\u2019s purpose was to kill time while unemployed and waiting for a call to serve as a minister.\nNow I follow all sorts of blogs. There are blogs about dogs, traveling, kids, cooking, religion, fitness, politics, crafts, parenting, writing, educating, interior design, you name it! There are even blogs about blogging!\nIndividuals run blogs. Groups of friends run blogs. Businesses run blogs. Religious institutions run blogs.\nBlogs are a way for people to connect over certain topics and interests, socializing in the ever-growing blogosphere. Chances are, you\u2019ve read blog posts without even realizing it. Most look like an article you\u2019d find on any website. But blog posts typically have a personal touch.\nThey\u2019re a wonderful way for people to share tips, tricks, tutorials, inspiration, and more with others.\nIf you want a more thorough definition of the term blog, this one is from Wikipedia.\nBlogs are also a way for businesses to advertise through honest reviews and giveaways. They partner up with bloggers to spread the word about their products or services. So, some bloggers are also advertisers.",

    "context": "It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.",

While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious.\nWe have all seen it\u2026the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things.\nUnfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the \u201cwrath of the Internet\u201d.\nAs some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective.\nTo help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect.\nDealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself.\nMy goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend \u2018Dealing With Disrespect\u2019 as something that can help put things in perspective.",

    "context": "When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers \u2014 about 80 people from all over the world \u2014 to test every recipe thoroughly.\nOnly one came back to me consistently with problems.\nFrom Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with \u201cdissolved\u201d gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared \u2013 O dove\u2019erano andati? \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d\nIn the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors \u2014 was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use \u201cproper\u201d ricotta? Aha.\n\u201cProper\u201d ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind \u2014 to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe.",

    "context": "For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.\nThe training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period.",

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don\u2019t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways.\nOne of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people.\nMy partner\u2019s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box.

If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.\nThe Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday.\nLawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.\n\nWith midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year.

Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices.\nContrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don\u2019t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables.\nWhile it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn\u2019t been well studied in large population groups.\nUsing data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn\u2019t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men.\nThe eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium.\nProving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium.\nFor someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement \u2018just in case\u2019 offers little to no benefit.",

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source\u2019s ecosystem.\nI am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.\nI find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said \u2018M$\u2019 instead of \u2018MS\u2019 (ugh.)\nThings have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me.\nThings have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don\u2019t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt.\nStill though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them?\nA little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft\u2019s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce proprietary software and use software patents in departments such as Windows and Office.",

    "context": "It has become increasingly common for academics to use social media to communicate with wider audiences. Twitter, like many other social platforms, typically measures success in terms of numbers of followers, likes and retweets, but this only tells us something about the spreading of messages but not necessarily whether the content of the messages is understood or embraced. One way to ascertain this is through network and language analysis, which, used together, can tell us how effective the communication is.\nEconomists tweet less, mention fewer people and have fewer conversations with strangers than a comparable group of experts in the sciences, and use less accessible language with words that are more complex, with more abbreviations and with a more distant tone. Their tweets are less personal and less inclusive than those used by scientists.\nThis is what appeared in April 2017 when we gathered data on tens of thousands of tweets from the Twitter accounts of both the top 25 economists and 25 scientists as identified by IDEAS and Science, including the top three economists at the time, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Erik Brynjolfsson and, on the other side, the top three scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, and Richard Dawkins. At that time those accounts covered roughly two thirds of all the following.\nThe timing is significant because 2016 has been declared the year of post-truth politics, the year in which appeals to emotions (pathos) superseded the significance of factual evidence-based information (logos), affecting people\u2019s constructions and interpretations of events. This has been accompanied by the growing prominence of political \u201calt\u201d movements (e.g. UKIP, the Alt-right) and their aggressive, provocative, and populist narratives, and \u201cfake news\u201d leading to political shock events such as Brexit and the Trump election.\nThe relatively low traction of economists in these public debates has been and continues to be an important issue. Does the public not trust economists? Don\u2019t they understand what economists do and how they work? Is their work misrepresented in the media? And how do economists themselves interact with public opinion?",

In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction.\nIn addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges \u2013 including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression.\nPractices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being\nAccept Your Feelings\nStuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don\u2019t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them \u2013 especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\nDon\u2019t stuff your emotions!\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand \u2013 not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature\u2019s way of releasing stress.

It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.\nPatch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast.

Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress.

It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm.

The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.)\nThe decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue.\n\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\"\nThe report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do.\n\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading the effort. \"Crucial to this effort is helping former prisoners find jobs.\"\n\"Nobody wins when former prisoners fail to adjust to life outside, or worse, end up back behind bars,\" Trump said.",

    "context": "Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid.\nThe pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously.\nThe pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.\nFruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily.",

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. \u201cIf our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,\u201d she says, \u201cthe medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.\u201d\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes\u2019 unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including globalization and multiculturalism,\u201d she adds.",

He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views.\nHe is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him.\nAs I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me.

In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.\u201d\nSacred Landscapes opens on October 10, 2017, at the Getty Museum, where it complements the exhibition Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith in Renaissance Venice.

He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School.\nKaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters.\nAt Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children.\nAfter law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal.\nKaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He governed from 2006 to 2010.",

Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed.\nEven then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving.\nNo matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you\u2019re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you\u2019re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming.\nLong story short: Moving is a process.\nIn the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time.\nThe largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation.\nFinding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home \u201cshow ready\u201d and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you\u2019ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods.\nMake a list of people you\u2019ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in.

I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.",

She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler.

Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated.\nTuesday\u2019s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea.\nTrump called the agreement \u201cvery comprehensive,\u201d but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington\u2019s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang\u2019s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress.\nSome in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program.\n\u201cNorth Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,\u201d said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul.\nOthers however offered praise for President Trump for keeping the diplomatic momentum moving forward, despite the lack of details in the agreement.",

Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do \u201csomething bad\u201d and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive.\nSo most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she\u2019d be happy because her life wasn\u2019t worsened at all.\nBut I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing.\nBut I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only \u201cfriend\u201d at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade.

She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.\nSo this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.\nBut my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.\nIf the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us.\nSometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.",

Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months.

Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island.\n\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\" Paul asked.\n\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\" she replied.\n\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\"\n\"You could call it something nice. Big Brother sounds so mean.\"\n\"What's mean about a reality show?\" said Paul, joking.\n\"What isn't bad about a reality show?\" countered Chloe, stepping in to defend her friend.",

His country would be very rich.\u201d Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House.\nPresident Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants.\nBut the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North\u2019s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.",

In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art.\nHis work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly.\nIt was truly amazing.\nIn 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall.\nThe kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too.

At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like.\nThe College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland\u2019s top business people.\nIn the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both \u2018school\u2019 or Junior College and college or university might be interesting. In fact, some of the world\u2019s top universities are thinking of such models for their own students: Stanford\u2019s 2025 project talks about the Open Loop, where learning and work happen over far more than the usual four year degree, offering students a chance to grow through not just learning, but contributing to society through their work, too.",

As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.",

The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,\u201d said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party.\nOn June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North\u2019s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953.\nMany South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country\u2019s trade, and the threat of military action.\nBut they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North\u2019s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief.\nHong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later.\nTrump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 election. Trump has strongly denied any allegations of collision with Moscow and has called the investigation a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",

His imagination ran wild with thoughts of kissing her full lips while his hands explored her lean, muscled body. Tonight he didn't need the whiskey to warm him up. But he kept drinking it anyway. She stepped away from the mike, sat her acoustic guitar on its stand, and walked down from the small stage. Jason beat all the other losers to the bar and sat down beside her. \"You must be pretty thirsty after all that beautiful singing.\" How many times had she heard that line? But at age 33, she'd probably heard every pickup line known to man. \"Yeah,\" she said, giving him a quick glance. He wasn't a bad looking guy. Probably a couple of inches shorter than her. At six-foot-two, she was accustomed to that. But a lot of men couldn't deal with her height. They liked to be the tall one in the relationship. Not that she'd had many relationships. Mostly one-nighters. Without her saying a word, the bartender sat a glass of ice down in front of her, and poured her a can of Diet Coke. \"Thanks, Joe.\" She took a sip as he walked away. \"I'm Jason.\" \"Sondra,\" she said, looking straight ahead as she took another sip. \"I really enjoyed your music--especially that last song. Did you write it yourself?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Wow. It was sad, but moving. You've got talent.\" Here we go, she thought. And I suppose you're a talent agent or a record producer, or you've got a friend in the business. And you'd be more than happy to get me a record deal--assuming I'd be willing to go with you right now to some sleazy motel. \"I'm sick of this business. In fact, you just heard my last performance. First thing Monday morning I'm going out to find me a real job. One that will pay the bills.\"",

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum\u2019s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of \u201cgreen spaces\u201d such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine.\nIn particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation.\nFor Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli\u2019s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.\u201d\nSacred Landscapes opens on October 10, 2017, at the Getty Museum, where it complements the exhibition Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith in Renaissance Venice.

This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while.

My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles\u2019 child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family.

Yes to\u2026 is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials.\nThere are 6 collections, each involves saying \u2018Yes to\u2019 a different fruit or vegetable. The products I\u2019ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*.\nYes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash \u2013 the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth.\nThe ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages.\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner \u2013 I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn\u2019t say they smell of carrots!\nMy thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards.

The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting.\nThe South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees.\n\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said.\nHowever, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future.\n\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News.\nNorth Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.\nThere were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.\nEarlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country no longer needed to conduct tests, because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons.",

    "context": "Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what we\u2014a group of museum curators and conservators\u2014did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of \u201crattling cups\u201d that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior.\nThe kantharos\u2019s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape\u2014and its striking decoration\u2014are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made.\nA Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: \u039a\u0391\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u03a0\u039f\u039b\u03a5\u0394\u0395\u03a5\u0399\u039a\u0395\u03a3 (\u201cKASTORPOLYDEUIKES\u201d). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus\u2014known together as the Dioskouroi\u2014and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for\u2014or in hope of\u2014safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup\u2019s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of sacrificial bulls) decorating the cup\u2019s body all evoke religious ritual. Although a common decorative motif in ancient Greek art, the band of running waves must also have reminded viewers of the gods\u2019 special role as saviors of seafarers.",

Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d about it.\nThe financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported.\nThat has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure.\nThe controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances \u2014 his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world.\nHere are six noteworthy takeaways from the report:\nGolf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to $210 million from nearly $300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than $20 million from $14 million.

Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.'

The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that.\nPaul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that.\nOf course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could.\nThe bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check.",

    "context": "No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do.\nDrumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate:\nThat is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them.\nMusic is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops \u2013 often on instruments like a wheelie bin \u2013 and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. \u201cWe were rehearsing in another room, and I said: \u2018This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,\u2019\u201d Krzysztof recalls. \u201cSo we burst into their office \u2013 they were a bit alarmed \u2013 and I said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve just got to sing this song to you.\u2019\u201d The song was \u201cMedia Vita\u201d, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof. Bowled over by their praise \u2013 he is a man whose emotions are close to the surface \u2013 Krzysztof asked if he could give them a hug, probably a first for all of them.",

It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously.\nThe pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.\nFruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily.",

Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, diabetes and much more.\nThe diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways.\nRed meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today\u2019s world are simply not eaten.\nIt should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the potential difficulties.\n1. The diet can be expensive.\nWhen you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.\nBut . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost.

Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived.\nGreg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost.\nGreg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance.\nGreg gladly paid $4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.\nHis little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn\u2019t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it\u2019s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/\u00a3millions.\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join \u201cnetworks\u201d and \u201ccommittees\u201d discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people \u2013 practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\nCentral to much of the impact is \u201caccess\u201d. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don\u2019t have these networks, so how can they develop them? One way is through the media.",

This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J.

As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before.

That isn\u2019t too weird, I do have cats, so even though by this point my fear is intense, I just sorta blow it off and keep trying to sleep.\nAnd then, something that\u2019s never happened in a situation like this, I feel something moving towards me on my bed.\nIt feels like a cats movements, with light feet making slight reverberations on the bed.\nSo my fear goes away entirely, and I\u2019m like \u201cOh okay, it\u2019s just the cat, that\u2019s good.\u201d And I lift my blankets off my head to let my cat under with me, and because the fear seemed to make the atmosphere under there very hot and tense, and then I look at my bed and there\u2019s nothing.\nSo I just pretend nothing happened and go to sleep, but that still sticks with me and even though it\u2019s kinda underwhelming I still think it was very strange since I wasn\u2019t at the \u201cedge of consciousness\u201d stage of going to sleep, so I feel like the chances I imagined it aren\u2019t too high.",

Then you can message each other and often you will get one or two messages and that\u2019s it unless you come out strong on the sexting and I guarantee you get your man.

The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting.\nThe South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees.\n\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said.\nHowever, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future.\n\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News.\nNorth Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.\nThere were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.\nEarlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country no longer needed to conduct tests, because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons.",

With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review.

I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.\nBUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise.

If you are not a grammar fanatic then you might be thinking 'hey, what are you whinging about - it is only a couple of letters out of order'.

    "context": "A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money. That might be the greatest challenge of all.",

I was lost and truly believed that I couldn\u2019t do any better (because I was sinking and couldn\u2019t figure out how to swim on my own).\nYes, you may have issues in whatever job your in\u2026 but to tell a newbie that they have to figure it out on their own\u2026 that\u2019s pretty ridiculous. If this is something you hear or think and asking others for help or finding a supportive environment is not an option\u2026 try replacing it with \u201clearn to fly on the way down\u201d.

To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes.\nHe was unpredictable and he didn\u2019t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow.\nEventually, the staff couldn\u2019t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.\nLast year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn\u2019t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner?\nHe was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

    "context": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don\u2019t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same \u2018ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.",

    "context": "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 The conservative leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party on Thursday spoke out against the upcoming U.S.\u2013North Korea summit. He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cI am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,\u201d said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party.\nOn June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North\u2019s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953.\nMany South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country\u2019s trade, and the threat of military action.\nBut they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North\u2019s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief.\nHong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later.\nTrump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 election. Trump has strongly denied any allegations of collision with Moscow and has called the investigation a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",

The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I\u2019d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah\u2019s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it\u2019s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I\u2019d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people\u2019s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.\nOur setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire\u2019s front right and one on Claire\u2019s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR\u2019s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave.

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has assailed Comey as a \"showboat'' and a \"liar.''",

We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko \u2013 a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common \u201chabits\u201d that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use.\n1. They \u201ctime-block\u201d their writing in advance\nScheduling \u2013 booking in time to write in advance \u2013 was the single most common habit of our writers.

Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing \u2013 and so made the process easier and less stressful.\n\u201cWhen I need to write I block out time. I\u2019m lucky in that I can work from home \u2013 I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand.

One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party\u2019s conservative and moderate wings.\nThe compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide $25 billion in funding for Trump\u2019s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\nRepublicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress.

The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,\u201d Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.\nLater, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy:\n\u201cThe border is going to be just as tough as it\u2019s been\u201d despite the executive order, he said.\nTrump\u2019s executive order went into effect immediately when he signed it, according to Gene Hamilton, counselor to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \"inconsistent\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada.\nShah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her.\n\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\"\nTrump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy.\nDaniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted $130,000 from Trump attorney Cohen to stay quiet.",

And the most important feature of the service was that texts of the wishes were not going to be predetermined and there would be no set list of pre-selected options. Messages would be created by a special software program from random words provided by a customer. Such a system would allow for truly unique greetings, and after all, nobody said they had to be comprehensible.\nCzesiek took care of the development of the software, which for now they named \"John of the Disc\". Czesiek had suitable experience in the matter. While on the forum for (select as appropriate) phobics he designed an application, which created slogans for street protests. The application, even though it produced phrases completely illogical and nonsensical, became quite popular, and some of its most unique catchphrases you could have seen on TV - \"Out With There Harm Out!\" or \"To Them Bag Away Now Now!\"\nTwo future men of success got to work and the SMS greeting portal bestbestbest.pl went live just before Easter.",

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.",

The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.\nTrump\u2019s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, \u201ca very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.\u201d\nThe U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\u201cIn terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d take it one way or the other. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d see it as negative or positive because they think they\u2019re different from anybody else anyway. They think they\u2019re a very special case,\u201d Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.\nWhile the Iran deal limited that country\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.\nBut apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions.\nJohn Delury, a North Korea analyst with Yonsei University in Seoul, said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is insurmountable but it adds yet another layer of difficulty.\u201d\nIn some ways Pyongyang may be reassured that a deal reached with the Trump administration would likely be supported by the next administration to follow.",

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of.\nWhile in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain\u2019t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take \u2013 don\u2019t accept or allow discrimination in your community.\nIn my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar \u2013 mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW.\nWhile universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980\u2019s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself?\nDavid Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold\u2019s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it\u2019s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.\nTo borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold:\n1. It\u2019s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media.\n2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are.\n3.

In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history.\nIn its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object\u2019s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation.\nIn early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display.\nAfter the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity.

As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?\nStarting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a \u201cculture of obstacles\u201d. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.",

    "context": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.\n\n\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\" the Indian prime minister said. \"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\"\n\nWhile those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea.\nModi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments \u2014 a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIndia has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.\n\nThe U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\" An important aspect of that partnership is \"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\" he added.\n\nFor decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \"return to great power rivalries.\"\n\nThe Indian prime minister also insisted that \"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\"\nIndia is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.",

    "context": "Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).",

Tillerson never explicitly denied the account.\nTillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump\u2019s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nAnd Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia \u2014 including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain.\nIn return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nWhen Trump ultimately made his decision last week to meet with Kim, he did so without consulting Tillerson.",

    "context": "I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that\u2019s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\n\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.",

Call her R.\nR was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories:\nShe wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts.\nShe received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham.\nAt which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome.\nI still feel for her.

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century.\nThe early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences.\nThe president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long.\nAmong those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities.\nTo date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century.\nWhite House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling.\nPresidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017.\n\"We are not done yet,\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\"\nObama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums.\nEggleston once again called on Congress to pass legislation overhauling the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\"It is critical that both the House and the Senate continue to work on a bipartisan basis to get a criminal justice reform bill to the president's desk,\" he wrote.",

    "context": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the $50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war.\nFor decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nLast month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied.\nChina gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal.\nBeijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.\n\nIn other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between $225 billion and $600 billion every year.\nThat rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \"We can't afford to give up our technology,\" Kudlow said Friday. \"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\"\nThe Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently target U.S. companies.",

All that said, flying strangles our planet as much as eating too much red meat, and for many, many reasons, I've wanted to stop flying quite so much, while not restricting the spread and growth of the ideas from our firm, NoTosh.\nI'm quite sure that nobody reading this blog really cares about how much I travel, but keeping an annual count on it has become a new year habit. When I started working at Channel 4, and then continuing when I created NoTosh, I wanted to keep track of what seemed like an interminable number of miles on the road and in the air. By 2012, 2013 and last year, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever be able to get the number of miles down when they seemed to represent even more trips to the moon and back each and every year.\nWhen you run a company based in Edinburgh with a great team living in Melbourne, you could easily spend your life on a plane - one flying to Melbourne feels better than two or more flying to Edinburgh. Indeed, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it felt like I really did spend my life on a plane, as I went to the moon and back in my annual travel, with anything up to seven trips a year to Australia.",

    "context": "In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\"\nIn other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.\nThe creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \"a local Amiga gaming championship\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest).\nThe school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.",

I always really love The Body Shop\u00ae Christmas make-up collections, and I think it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up.\nThen everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products.

It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are.\nI also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop\u00ae are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just \u00a345. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There\u2019s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just \u00a350 which I thought was a great fun idea.",

It\u2019s going to be a multiyear long process,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.\nPresident Trump has said he expects a \"very positive result\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North\u2019s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\"\nThis position aligns closer to the Kim government\u2019s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals with North Korea and Ukraine\u2019s experience in dismantling its nuclear arsenal after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served.\nBut his freedom came with a price, something that didn\u2019t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office.\n\u201cAt the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d Meade says.\nFourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can\u2019t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration.\nHome to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state\u2019s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6.\nHe\u2019s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they\u2019ve completed the terms of their sentence.\nThe measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system,\u201d Meade says confidently. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we\u2019re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.\u201d",

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart.\nThe two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it.\nHe knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.\nFrom behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown.\nA shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

It was our first trip to Puerto Rico.\nThe hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there.\nWe dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red.\nWhen the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine.\nThe waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought.\nUnfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire.\nThe waiter\u2019s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide.

And smoke; the nail was plastic!\nQuickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under.\nEver the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I\u2019m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.\nSo much for my attempt at appearing \u201cclassy\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d\u2026.",

    "context": "Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).",

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes.\nThey decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks.\nThe bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago.\nThe scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock.\nThe next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.",

Forget the story,' \" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\"\nTrump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy.\nDaniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press.

At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

The first produced a joint peace declaration promoting humanitarian exchanges and economic cooperation.\nFrom the second came support for a permanent peace treaty and a U.S. and China-led deal to end Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program for economic assistance and security guarantees.\nHowever, North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear development efforts and missile tests, in violation of past agreements, and other hostile acts, including a alleged deadly attack on a South Korean naval ship in 2010, brought an end to any progress made at these summits.\nLeading up to this week\u2019s inter-Korean summit, there are encouraging developments that a nuclear deal may again be within reach.\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign, that led efforts to impose harsh international sanctions ending most North Korean exports, are exerting increasing economic pain that could be pressuring the leadership in Pyongyang to actually give up its nuclear arsenal this time.\n\"If the situation continues, the foreign exchange could be depleted and North Korea can face a very serious situation at the end of this year. This is one of the reasons why it has come out in favor of dialogue,\" said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made a number of concessions already by agreeing to talk about denuclearization without conditions, by appearing to drop past demands that the U.S. end its military presence on the Korean peninsula, and most recently by announcing the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, and closure of the country\u2019s nuclear test site.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served.\nBut his freedom came with a price, something that didn\u2019t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office.\n\u201cAt the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d Meade says.\nFourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can\u2019t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration.\nHome to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state\u2019s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6.\nHe\u2019s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they\u2019ve completed the terms of their sentence.\nThe measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system,\u201d Meade says confidently. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we\u2019re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.\u201d",

Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017.\n\"We are not done yet,\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\"\nObama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums.\nEggleston once again called on Congress to pass legislation overhauling the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\"It is critical that both the House and the Senate continue to work on a bipartisan basis to get a criminal justice reform bill to the president's desk,\" he wrote.",

Trump said his decision was based on the \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility displayed\u201d by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model.\nNorth Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government\u2019s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S.\nPyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North\u2019s security demands are met.\nMoon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nOn Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers.\n\u201cWhat is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security of the regime if North Korea does denuclearize,\u201d Moon said.\nTrump has said Kim would be both secure in his rule and rich, as the U.S. and other countries would offer substantial economic aid and investment.",

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I\u2019m \u201calways busy.\u201d\nSeventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled.\nA mother\u2019s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn\u2019t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning.\nMy usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day.\nSo I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden.\nInside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.\nBetter mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don\u2019t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways.\nOne of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people.\nMy partner\u2019s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn\u2019t even part of your ancestry. It\u2019s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don\u2019t really want.\nSoon after that, my partner\u2019s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.\nI think the experience made us both content to elope.",

But it is still unclear if real progress toward peace can be achieved.\nThere have been two past inter-Korean Summits in 2000 and 2007, both held in the North. The first produced a joint peace declaration promoting humanitarian exchanges and economic cooperation.\nFrom the second came support for a permanent peace treaty and a U.S. and China-led deal to end Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program for economic assistance and security guarantees.\nHowever, North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear development efforts and missile tests, in violation of past agreements, and other hostile acts, including a alleged deadly attack on a South Korean naval ship in 2010, brought an end to any progress made at these summits.\nLeading up to this week\u2019s inter-Korean summit, there are encouraging developments that a nuclear deal may again be within reach.\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign, that led efforts to impose harsh international sanctions ending most North Korean exports, are exerting increasing economic pain that could be pressuring the leadership in Pyongyang to actually give up its nuclear arsenal this time.\n\"If the situation continues, the foreign exchange could be depleted and North Korea can face a very serious situation at the end of this year. This is one of the reasons why it has come out in favor of dialogue,\" said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made a number of concessions already by agreeing to talk about denuclearization without conditions, by appearing to drop past demands that the U.S. end its military presence on the Korean peninsula, and most recently by announcing the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, and closure of the country\u2019s nuclear test site.",

    "context": "Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what we\u2014a group of museum curators and conservators\u2014did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of \u201crattling cups\u201d that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior.\nThe kantharos\u2019s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape\u2014and its striking decoration\u2014are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made.\nA Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: \u039a\u0391\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u03a0\u039f\u039b\u03a5\u0394\u0395\u03a5\u0399\u039a\u0395\u03a3 (\u201cKASTORPOLYDEUIKES\u201d). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus\u2014known together as the Dioskouroi\u2014and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for\u2014or in hope of\u2014safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup\u2019s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of sacrificial bulls) decorating the cup\u2019s body all evoke religious ritual. Although a common decorative motif in ancient Greek art, the band of running waves must also have reminded viewers of the gods\u2019 special role as saviors of seafarers.",

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper.

The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer.

He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church.",

That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs.\nMulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress.\nBut he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent.\n\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\" he said.\nUnder the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high $700 billion for 2018 \u2014 fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge.\n\"We took care of the military like it's never been taken care of before,\" Trump said Monday.",

They\u2019re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that.

Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko \u2013 a digital coaching tool for writers.

Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing \u2013 and so made the process easier and less stressful.\n\u201cWhen I need to write I block out time. I\u2019m lucky in that I can work from home \u2013 I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.",

But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement.\nNorth Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country\u2019s external trade.\nSeeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal.\nBut easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North\u2019s denuclearization promises.\n\u201cOnce the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,\u201d said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program.\nSouth Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed.\nAt the recent inter-Korean summit, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to increase economic cooperation, in addition to supporting the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.",

The family didn't have a lot of cash, the grandpa worked hard every day of his life, but no matter how relentless the day-to-day was, he would always repeat this phrase as a reminder to those around him that, at the end of the day, this is all still amazing to be part of.\nThis kind of optimism, as you might call it, can often disappear in a flash in the busy-ness of business or school. Things become impossible, hardgoing, relentless(ly difficult). And the reasons we give for that busyness nearly always involve someone or something else - the system, the job, the weather...\nFor many years, people would ask the salutary \"how are you?\" and my answer was a stock one: \"I'm tired.\"\nIt was my wife who pointed it out to me, presumably because everyone else was too polite to express their boredom with my reply. The fact is, most people feel tired most of the time, until they make a switch in their life. That switch is deciding that the only person who can turn that frown upside down, who can make crazy stuff happen (or attempt to, and enjoy the process), is you. And in Vonnegut's case, that switch came from saying out loud the one phrase that brings us back to the good elements in what we or our team or our family is doing at any given moment: If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.",

If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.",

Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head.\nTooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain.\nProblem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.\nI chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I\u2019ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.",

We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads.\nBTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month.\n(Source)\nAs she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity.\nBut the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.\nSo this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.\nBut my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.\nIf the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us.\nSometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.",

Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of.\nThe key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality.\nDigging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised.\nA paradigm shift? Not quite\nDoes this study turn on its head \u2018everything we knew about nutrition?\u2019 Not quite.

And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.\nI\u2019m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen.\nWe have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he\u2019s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals\u2026and make me out to be a liar!\nAnyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they\u2019ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I\u2019d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it\u2019d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road!\nWhen you\u2019re preparing a lot of food, you\u2019re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn\u2019t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I\u2019d like not having to smell the garbage all the time!",

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there.\nHe could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near.\nPatch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.\nPatch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed.\n\"Hello, Patch,\" Brighteyes said weakly. \"Would you like to come in?\"\nPatch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded.",

The candidate was given 24 hours to call the hospital, talk to his wife, learn more of the situation and make a decision. He ended up staying in the pipeline and graduated. His child was born with minor complications but is healthy to this day.\nIt may not be an exact teacher to a student scenario, but it hits pretty damn close to those of us who went through military training.",

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric.\nTrump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East.\n\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\"\nThe president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \"We are very proud of it,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\"\nIn fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.\nThe tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership.\n\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.",

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d.

Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats.\nThe losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming.\n\"You know, you have a very unpopular president.

I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K.

They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \"sporf\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design.\nThe sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.\nIn strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year.\nIt is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.",

Solving social problems is hard though, which ain\u2019t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take \u2013 don\u2019t accept or allow discrimination in your community.\nIn my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar \u2013 mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.",

    "context": "Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries \u2013 heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food \u2013 has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that\u2019s why it is commonly added in processed foods.\nCombining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.\nTeasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken.\nSalt promotes over-eating\nEleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn\u2019t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.",

The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.\nThe telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette.\n\"Admit it now, Ray.\" She sounded petulant.\n\"Fine, I admit it.

    "context": "A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money. That might be the greatest challenge of all.",

What do you think?\" And I told her: \"I love the little guy.\"\nHe was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything.

Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man.\nSteve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited.

Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views.

Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it\u2019s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover.

And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing.\nKey to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).",

Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, diabetes and much more.\nThe diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways.\nRed meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today\u2019s world are simply not eaten.\nIt should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the potential difficulties.\n1. The diet can be expensive.\nWhen you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.\nBut . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.",

    "context": "I\u2019ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I\u2019ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\nToday I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag.\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.",

I\u2019m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals.\nOne of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn\u2019t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant.

With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success \u2013 dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare?\nWith regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I\u2019ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I\u2019ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they\u2019ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I\u2019ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.",

Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. \u201cHis car crashed.\u201d, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut.\nBut as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights.\nThe van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving.\nBasically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.",

I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills.\nLet me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas.

My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her $5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks!

One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes.\nThey decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks.\nThe bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago.\nThe scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock.\nThe next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.",

(And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)\nNot all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles.\nOr maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults?\nI\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.\nBut it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.\nSo I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.\nThis month, you\u2019ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I\u2019ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu\n* What to know about flu shots for older adults\n* What\u2019s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu season\n* Which influenza vaccination is probably best for most older adults\n* What to do if your older parent or relative is unwilling or unable to get vaccinated",

    "context": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don\u2019t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same \u2018ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.",

My sister introduced us making sure to introduce me as \u201cDr. Lea (I think that was the first, last, and only time she called me \u2018Dr.\u201d). He then turns to my dad and asked what happened. Knowing how difficult it is to understand Dad, I start to answer. My bad. The doctor abruptly stops me and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you. I want him to tell me.\u201d In hindsight, I realize he wanted to hear dad\u2019s speech as a part of his assessment. Dad begins. His speech is slow and very very slurred. Dr. Hotshot looks totally befuddled. Dad had gotten out about 3 sentences out when Dr. Hotshot stops him and abruptly asks, \u201cDoes he always talk like that?\u201d My sister, without missing a beat, replies, \u201cNo, sometimes he speaks French.\u201d As I am trying to not swallow my head to keep from laughing, I notice the nurse in the room has buried her mouth in her shoulder. Dr. Hotshot exits. A scan shows no damage. And, for the record, Dad never did learn to speak French.",

Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.\n\n\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\" Diaz-Canel said.\nDiaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution.\nHe succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006.\nWhile the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader.\n\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.''\nCastro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party.\nDiaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.\nSince Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been synonymous with Cuba.

This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J.

As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before.

    "context": "With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation.\nMy days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week.\nAnd with that, The Friday Thing was born.\nTo promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked journalists and the campaign was picked up by just about every major newspaper, local radio station and even made it on to the BBC.",

It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that\u2019s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn\u2019t what is recommended anymore.

A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van.

    "context": "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens is stored in your sub-conscious.",

Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere.\nNow my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a \u2018customer is always right\u2019 the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite \u2018fuck off'.\nAll I say is \u2018Good\u2019 and move on to the next customer.\nHitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction.\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.\n\nThey also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\"\n\nSome of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.\n\n\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \"without a warrant.\"",

Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon.\nI don\u2019t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked.

But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So \u2026 I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too.

    "context": "Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family.\nThe 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media.\nThe move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.\n\n\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\" Diaz-Canel said.\nDiaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution.\nHe succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006.\nWhile the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader.\n\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.''\nCastro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party.\nDiaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.\nSince Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been synonymous with Cuba. The Castros leave behind a history of defiance against the United States, as well as a long record of oppression.",

    "context": "One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa\u2019s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display.\nBringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask\u2014and answer\u2014several questions about it. Who\u2014if anyone\u2014does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history.\nIn its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object\u2019s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation.\nIn early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display.\nAfter the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a closer look at the curious origin and function of this sculpture type.",

    "context": "Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you\u2019re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let\u2019s examine the diet cycle mentality.\nTHERE IS A MAGIC CURE\nThe reason you haven\u2019t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven\u2019t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off.\nONE LAST DIET\nOnce you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body\u2019s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.\nYOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS\nYou really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat!\nI WANT TO BREAK FREE!!\nThe only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss?",

This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it\u2019s just not my cup of tea.\nFor one thing, I\u2019m not a gambler, like at all.

Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months.

I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it\u2019s all OK, but I can\u2019t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom.

It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself.\n\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\" Koppelman said. \"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\"\nAsked by reporters Monday about Trump\u2019s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \"The president hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\nWhittington, a professor of politics, told VOA News, \"The courts have recognized some implicit limits on the pardoning power in the past and they would have to assess whether a self-pardon is legally valid or falls outside the scope of the pardoning power.

It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks.\nThe bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago.\nThe scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock.\nThe next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.",

You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off.\nONE LAST DIET\nOnce you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body\u2019s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.\nYOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS\nYou really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat!\nI WANT TO BREAK FREE!!\nThe only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss?",

    "context": "If you\u2019ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.",

    "context": "For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.\nThe training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period.",

He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.\nBut there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.\nThe date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.",

She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond.

Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren\u2019t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto.\nAnd then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid\u2019s hair than a monk\u2019s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn\u2019t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn\u2019t, in that you won\u2019t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they\u2019re not particularly difficult to find now. They\u2019re just one of those special things that don\u2019t last long. Blink and you\u2019ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It\u2019s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).\nIf you\u2019ve never tasted agretti before, it\u2019s worth seeking out if you\u2019re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, \u201cWhile agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring.\u201d",

Things become impossible, hardgoing, relentless(ly difficult).

The fact is, most people feel tired most of the time, until they make a switch in their life. That switch is deciding that the only person who can turn that frown upside down, who can make crazy stuff happen (or attempt to, and enjoy the process), is you.

Maybe i\u2019m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I\u2019m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious \ud83d\ude09 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they\u2019ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame.

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities.

When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d.

I want to talk about the ugly.\nWe connect people.\nThat can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.\nAnd still we connect people.\nThe ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.\nAnd up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients\u2019 health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right.\nEach time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it\u2019s clear that this is just lip service at this point.",

However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on the OGE\u2019s letter to charge that Trump\u2019s earlier omission of the payment could amount to a violation of federal laws on financial disclosures.",

With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.\nIn strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year.\nIt is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.",

Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer.\nThere was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard.\nSo I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot.\nI make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected.\nI tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \"To get me the Hell out of his office.\"\nNeedless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human.",

    "context": "I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that\u2019s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\n\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.",

It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property.

He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually.\nHe was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.",

Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries.\nThe project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it.\nI\u2019m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.).

The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.",

But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors \u2014 was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use \u201cproper\u201d ricotta? Aha.\n\u201cProper\u201d ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind \u2014 to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this.

Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.",

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it\u2019s my first time walking through my local market.\nThere are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany\u2019s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren\u2019t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto.\nAnd then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid\u2019s hair than a monk\u2019s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn\u2019t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn\u2019t, in that you won\u2019t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they\u2019re not particularly difficult to find now.

It\u2019s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).\nIf you\u2019ve never tasted agretti before, it\u2019s worth seeking out if you\u2019re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

He was ever so slightly worried about leaving his car out of sight in this neighborhood, but really it was his nervousness about the party that tied his stomach in knots. A $120 bottle of champagne under his arm, Paul walked bravely up to the front door, which opened from within before he could touch the doorbell.\n\"8:17!\" shouted Chloe as she flung the door wide, a wristwatch held in her hand. \"Who bet closest to 8:17?\" Chloe wore a green and blue sari wrapped low around her waist and a white t-shirt on which someone had used a sharpie to write \"HOOK-HER\" on the front.\nA young, stocky Asian American woman named Bee stepped forward. She held a little piece of paper in her hand, which she shoved playfully in front of Chloe's face. \"8:15! I had 8:15!\"\nBehind the two women a tall, rail-thin man appeared, wearing a faded blue polo shirt with the Microsoft logo on it and a pair of khakis. Paul recognized him as Raff, whom he'd met the night before. \"Just barely beat my 8:00.\" He said. Raff was the computer guy - the lead hacker in the group who'd been responsible for sorting through the reams of electronic data they'd stolen and finding the juicy bits. He'd also masterminded the attack on the company Web site and some of the other problems that had tied his former partners up in the hours after Paul had gotten the check. \"I wanted to bet 'never' but Chloe had already taken that one.\"\n\"Don't listen to him, Paul,\" said Chloe. \"I just bet never because I knew everyone else would want it and I alone had faith in your return. But the others decided to have a little betting pool about when you'd finally show up after you pulled your little disappearing act earlier.\" Chloe waggled her finger at him in mock scolding. \"You're a naughty little boy, giving me the slip like that.\"",

I never molested anyone,\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.\n\nJones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate.\n\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\" Jones said.\nTrump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday.\n\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\" he said.\nTrump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him.\n\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\" Trump said.\nIn the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda.\n\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\" Moore said.\n\nDemocrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are.

Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on the OGE\u2019s letter to charge that Trump\u2019s earlier omission of the payment could amount to a violation of federal laws on financial disclosures.",

    "context": "Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we\u2019re inactive until the next day.\nThe reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten.\nThere is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits.\nSo even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn\u2019t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of \u2018normal\u2019 evening eating.\nAdvice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants\u2019 diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period.\nEating at night a waistline hazard\nSo did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.",

Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn\u2019t say they smell of carrots!\nMy thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards.

Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries.\nThe project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it.\nI\u2019m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn\u2019t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it\u2019s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/\u00a3millions.\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join \u201cnetworks\u201d and \u201ccommittees\u201d discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people \u2013 practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\nCentral to much of the impact is \u201caccess\u201d. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him.

It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country\u2019s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\nLast Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations \u2014 more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria apply for sentence commutations.",

Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed.\n\"Hello, Patch,\" Brighteyes said weakly. \"Would you like to come in?\"\nPatch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded.",

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success.\nAdd a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine\nA simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities \u2013 the things you are going to do anyway.\nFor example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster.\nAs you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories.\nWhen it\u2019s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can \u2013 stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal.\nWhen you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song \u2013 make those tiles shine.\nPlay fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum.\nWork for longer periods of time \u2013 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism.\nThese are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping.",

However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact.\nMost recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third.\nThe main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits\u2019 high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.\nEating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits \u2013 in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears \u2013 could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nThe study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.\nIn the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process.\nSo, our question for today is:\nWhat are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life \u2013 although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life.\nWhat has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, heart diseases, etc.\nThat alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that.\nUnfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. \u2013 basically empty calories.\nObesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole.\nThere is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries \u2013 it\u2019s easier and tastier.",

I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn\u2019t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke! When I walked into my house, I was immediately confronted on why was I late, why did I smell like smoke, etc.! I burst into tears, and had to tell about my horrible day, but I didn\u2019t get into trouble! WHEW!",

    "context": "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens is stored in your sub-conscious.",

The base even has its own golf course.\n\u201cI have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I\u2019ve ever been on.

My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn\u2019t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!)

If it\u2019s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that\u2019s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it\u2019s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don\u2019t want the item, let it be. They\u2019ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help.\nPACK\nIf you know you don\u2019t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it\u2019s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it\u2019s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.",

The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone.\nThere may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet \u2013 others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle.\nHowever, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, diabetes and much more.\nThe diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways.\nRed meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today\u2019s world are simply not eaten.\nIt should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the potential difficulties.\n1. The diet can be expensive.\nWhen you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.\nBut . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.",

Sitting at the bar in Se\u00f1or Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew.\nHe had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra.

I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating.

The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey.\n\"What do you want?\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals.\nAn unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\" Patch said. \"Who are you that asks?\"\n\"I am Snout,\" the rat replied. \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I came to look for food.\"\n\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\"\n\"Your food?\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\"\n\"Then you belong to us,\" Snout hissed. \"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\"",

A new school was built elsewhere.\nA one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby.\nAlso Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning.\nMichael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs.\nHe refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.''\nA motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church.",

Yes to\u2026 is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials.\nThere are 6 collections, each involves saying \u2018Yes to\u2019 a different fruit or vegetable.

This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth.\nThe ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages.\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner \u2013 I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn\u2019t say they smell of carrots!\nMy thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards.

No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong.

I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or \u201ccomplete physical.\u201d\nLast but not least, blood testing is usually \u2014 although not always \u2014 very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.\nFatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things.\nConfused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more.\nLike much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults.\nHistorically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.\nIn fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)\nThis way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older adults.\nSpecifically, I\u2019ll cover four \u201cpanels\u201d which are commonly ordered, and then I\u2019ll list six more blood tests that I find especially useful.",

He looks it over and says \u201cOK, good job\u201d or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week\u2019s assignment required 6\u20137 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any \u2018after school help!\u2019\nThis was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough. I know none of that is allowed these days, but those were both good deterrents for me!!",

This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn\u2019t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers.\nI have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don\u2019t like this.\nI believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.\nAs such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically \u201cit is my blog and I can run it how I like\u201c.\nThis is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.",

Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera.\n\"Motherfucker,\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.\nI didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off.",

Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.\nThe school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision.

The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie\u2019s script.

For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn\u2019t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn\u2019t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I\u2019m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects.

As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded.

Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats.\nThe losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year.

It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country\u2019s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\nLast Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations \u2014 more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria apply for sentence commutations.",

The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate.\nIn Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \"No Such Address\" or simply \"Return to Sender\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill.

Castro will remain party leader.\n\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.''\nCastro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party.\nDiaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.\nSince Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been synonymous with Cuba. The Castros leave behind a history of defiance against the United States, as well as a long record of oppression.",

    "context": "Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived.\nGreg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost.\nGreg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance.\nGreg gladly paid $4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.\nHis little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.",

    "context": "Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.\nTuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout.\nTrump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \"puppet\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington.\nThe election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.",

Those days where the wind is so strong you can\u2019t instastory for talking (I\u2019m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer \u2018er, not sure\u2019.\nSo I thought I\u2019d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn\u2019t be calling myself a travel blogger.

The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including globalization and multiculturalism,\u201d she adds.",

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart.\nThe two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it.\nHe knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.\nFrom behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown.\nA shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.",

It\u2019s going to be a multiyear long process,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.\nPresident Trump has said he expects a \"very positive result\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North\u2019s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\"\nThis position aligns closer to the Kim government\u2019s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals with North Korea and Ukraine\u2019s experience in dismantling its nuclear arsenal after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.",

Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names.\nTrento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones.\nEating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites. Somehow there was always room for dessert, though \u2014 adopted from German and Austrian specialties, you can find cakes like black forest, schwarzplententorte (buckwheat cake, the recipe is below), sachertorte and linzertorte, often lathered with homemade, forest-picked berry jam and whipped cream.",

Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts.

Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally.\nRepublicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election.

The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic\u2019s Board of Directors.\nIt was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences.",

Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee...\nAs Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard.\nBut what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28.\nBut I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\nAt the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus.\nAfter the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her.",

I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don\u2019t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i\u2019m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I\u2019m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious \ud83d\ude09 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they\u2019ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a very specifically located circular cutter.",

Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why.\nBut those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk?\nShe stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques.

Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public.\nIn a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer.\n\u201cMichael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\"\n\u201cI assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,\u201d Hannity said.\nFox News also responded to the revelation. \"While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday (Monday), we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support,\" the network said.",

    "context": "Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter:\n\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source technology and approaches.",

    "context": "Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one.\nWhy You Should Interview Real Estate Agents\nTruth be told, I have only purchased one house and I\u2019m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter.\nIf you have ever shared with friends or family that you\u2019re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, \u201cOh! I know a realtor I can recommend!\u201d Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well.\nI still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they\u2019ll interact with your child. When you\u2019re an employer, you interview any potential employees.\nDon\u2019t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends\nJust because a friend is a realtor, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn\u2019t mean you have to hire him/her. It\u2019s business and nobody should take it personally.\nInterviewing real estate agents just makes sense.\nOftentimes, people don\u2019t.\nWhy not just use the realtor that sold you the house you\u2019re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer\u2019s agent? Do you know if they\u2019ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won\u2019t hurt.",

    "context": "When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. \u201cIt is the key to self improvement!\u201d, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don\u2019t quite practice what they preach.\nSeeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.",

Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters.

Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.",

Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.\nThere were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.\nEarlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country no longer needed to conduct tests, because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons.",

The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons.\nThe combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees.\nTrump\u2019s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.\nCalling the U.S. attack on Syria \u201ca warning for Pyongyang,\u201d the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, \u201cIf Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.\u201d\nFrom this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit.\n\u201cUnless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,\u201d said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul\nHowever the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the country more vulnerable to a similar attack.\n\u201cIf it thinks that its regime is not guaranteed, it will keep the nuclear program,\u201d said Kim Hyun-wook, a professor of American studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.",

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\"\nThe most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters.\n\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\"\nPelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials.\nTrump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman \u2014 whom he referred to as an \"extraordinarily low IQ person\" \u2014 had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \"Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\nLast week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed.\nTrump policy adviser Stephen Miller, also an immigration hard-liner, was called a \"fascist\" while dining at a Mexican cantina in a neighborhood in the District of Columbia.\nThe incident involving Sanders took place Friday night at the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, 300 kilometers south of the U.S. capital.\n\"I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation,\" owner Stephanie Wilkinson told The Washington Post, adding she believed Sanders works for an \"inhumane and unethical\" administration.",

    "context": "The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more.  It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success.\nAdd a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine\nA simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities \u2013 the things you are going to do anyway.\nFor example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster.\nAs you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories.\nWhen it\u2019s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can \u2013 stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal.\nWhen you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song \u2013 make those tiles shine.\nPlay fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum.\nWork for longer periods of time \u2013 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism.\nThese are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping.",

I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also. He asked me for a hug and just raised an eyebrow, then I saw my work had printed so I lent over to grab it and he thought I was going in for the hug. So he shut his eyes and held out his arms only to open them to see me walking off with my paper.

What was the situation and what did you do or say?\u201d\nAs senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won\u2019t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient.\nOn one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own.\nSuddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says \u201c[insert demand here] or I\u2019m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].\u201d\nThe situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, \u201cSTOP! DROP IT, NOW!\u201d He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying.\nWhat happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it\u2019s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren\u2019t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation\u2019s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved.\n* IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes.

Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

    "context": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don\u2019t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same \u2018ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

That target should be clear \u2013 and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process.\nIf you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing \u2013 and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target.\nMaybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself.\nHonest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.",

I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages.\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner \u2013 I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn\u2019t say they smell of carrots!\nMy thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards. I can run a brush straight through it when drying without having to get all the knots out first!",

Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave.

The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units.\nDavid Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\" he told VOA.\nThe administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts \u2013 that should be the end of the policy,\" Bier added.\nThe moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties.\nNielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act.\n\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\" the secretary said. \"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\"\nThe outcome of the votes is uncertain.

It\u2019s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.\u201d Professor Brian Boyd\nNo area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people.\nMost schools do not \u2018partner\u2019 with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like.\nThe College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland\u2019s top business people.\nIn the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both \u2018school\u2019 or Junior College and college or university might be interesting. In fact, some of the world\u2019s top universities are thinking of such models for their own students: Stanford\u2019s 2025 project talks about the Open Loop, where learning and work happen over far more than the usual four year degree, offering students a chance to grow through not just learning, but contributing to society through their work, too.",

Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's.\nOf course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint.\nDr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning.

    "context": "WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS \u2014 A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents.\n\"We have a plan to do that,\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning.\nShortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units.\nDavid Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\" he told VOA.\nThe administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts \u2013 that should be the end of the policy,\" Bier added.\nThe moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties.\nNielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act.\n\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\" the secretary said. \"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\"\nThe outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party's conservative and moderate wings.",

    "context": "I repeatedly see people asking advice on forums as to which is the best detox to do. Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nMy family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses.\nMy dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between.\nIt was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed.\nAs I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway.\nSome people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools.\nI remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether.\nI don\u2019t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn\u2019t do a good job.\nLater in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.\nI still remember hating shoveling snow.

This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home!\nThere are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I\u2019ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it\u2019s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include \u2018drawing oils\u2019 that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.",

It's very simple,\" he said.\nOpinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \"You know what it is? You get complacent,\" he said. \"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\"\nThe president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November.\n\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\" Trump told the audience. \"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\"\nAccording to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans.

I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response.\n\"I'm not sure,\" Poskin said.\nLike many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China.\nThose fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\" Poskin said. \"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef \u2014 [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\"\nThe announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly.\nTrump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology.\nU.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks.\n\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday.\nSome U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown.\nWilliam Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \"hair on fire\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy.\n\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\" he said in a statement to VOA.\nZarit pointed to a recent survey suggesting members of his organization wanted the White House to \"advocate more strongly for a level playing field and for reciprocal treatment to improve market access\" in China.",

    "context": "U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog.\nUnder U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency.\nIn Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d about it.\nThe financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported.\nThat has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure.\nThe controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances \u2014 his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world.\nHere are six noteworthy takeaways from the report:\nGolf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to $210 million from nearly $300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than $20 million from $14 million.

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.",

    "context": "For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.\nThe training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period.

It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.\nNow, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old.

(And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)\nNot all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles.\nOr maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults?\nI\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.\nBut it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.\nSo I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice.\nAt a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\" he said.\nOpinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \"You know what it is?

We have to go out, right?\"\nThe president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November.\n\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\" Trump told the audience. \"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\"\nAccording to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.\nHistorically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent.

What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.\nBefore embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants\u2019 generosity and kindness towards me, with many offers of help for proofreading, general career tips, and encouragement. There was a shared understanding of, and empathy with, the difficulties of the PhD process, and not only was this helpful to me as a scholar, but also as an individual.",

    "context": "Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you\u2019re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let\u2019s examine the diet cycle mentality.\nTHERE IS A MAGIC CURE\nThe reason you haven\u2019t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven\u2019t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off.\nONE LAST DIET\nOnce you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body\u2019s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.\nYOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS\nYou really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat!\nI WANT TO BREAK FREE!!\nThe only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss?",

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats.

Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on the OGE\u2019s letter to charge that Trump\u2019s earlier omission of the payment could amount to a violation of federal laws on financial disclosures.",

Maybe it's about time we understood.\"\nOne attendee shouted at the president to \"stop hiding behind the armed services and the national anthem.\" That prompted booing and the man was escorted from the event.\nTrump concluded by saying that the celebration turned out to be \"even bigger than we anticipated\" had the football players attended.\nMedia reports said as few as five to 10 players had planned to attend Tuesday's event. \"The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans,\" the White House said in a statement Tuesday.\n\"The Eagles are the ones who tried to change their commitment at the 11th hour,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters just prior to the event. \"If this wasn't a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned to attend the event and then backed out at the last minute.\"\nA White House statement said Trump withdrew the invitation \"after extensive discussions\" with the team.",

If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\nDespite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \"try and stay away\" from the Justice Department, but \"at some point, I won't.\"\nSupporters of the Special Counsel bill hailed it as a victory for the rule of law and said it would send a message that the president doesn't have unfettered authority.",

Sometimes the mom\u2019s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining.\nNothing is worse than the look on a woman\u2019s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn\u2019t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it.\nMy own daughter called me one day to announce she was pregnant and two days later, we found out she was miscarrying and I bawled all day. I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water.\nI have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don\u2019t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news. If they call me for their lab results, they might be driving, they might be walking around the mall, they will have to call their significant other and break the news, such difficult conversations to have over the phone.\nI have been very, very lucky that the few times I have seen advanced pregnancies that underwent a fetal demise were handled by the physicians that I have worked with. I can\u2019t imagine being almost ready to deliver and having all your hopes and dreams crushed.

    "context": "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens is stored in your sub-conscious.",

She stepped away from the mike, sat her acoustic guitar on its stand, and walked down from the small stage. Jason beat all the other losers to the bar and sat down beside her. \"You must be pretty thirsty after all that beautiful singing.\" How many times had she heard that line?

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served.\nBut his freedom came with a price, something that didn\u2019t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office.\n\u201cAt the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d Meade says.\nFourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can\u2019t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration.\nHome to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state\u2019s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6.\nHe\u2019s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they\u2019ve completed the terms of their sentence.\nThe measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system,\u201d Meade says confidently. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we\u2019re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.\u201d",

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter.\nThe very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village.\nOne morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them.\n\"I don't mind telling you,\" Lenny said, \"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk.\n\"No need to be afraid,\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \"The Easter Bunny will provide.\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.",

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations.

Anyone that\u2019s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it\u2019s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don\u2019t want the item, let it be. They\u2019ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help.\nPACK\nIf you know you don\u2019t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it\u2019s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it\u2019s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.",

A young lady I met in the hospital cafeteria where I worked as a pharmacy intern (she was an X-ray tech) I asked out on a date. Would you like to follow me home? she asked. I said SURE!\nShe got in her car, hit the freeway, went over the top of the hill..and was gone. I went 75 mph desperately trying to keep her tail lights in my line of sight while swerving in and out of traffic. I thought if you don\u2019t really want to go out with me, just tell me, don\u2019t try to ditch me! I finally caught up with her but found out she always drives that way. If Janet Guthrie wasn\u2019t the first woman to drive in the Indy 500, she would have been.\nOver the years as she got older, collecting speeding tickets got old so she became a more responsible driver. I\u2019m glad, because I had to help pay for those tickets over the last 30+ years we\u2019ve been married. Glad I caught up to her that one night on the freeway.\nEDIT, AND BACKSTORY:\nShe ate lunch with her X-ray tech coworkers. She left the table first and I approached the others and asked what was her name, the girl that just left. They told me, and about a half hour later called the radiology department from the pharmacy phone and asked for her.\nShe said all the girls in the department were huddled around the phone and giggling while we talked. It\u2019s the handsome blonde intern in the pharmacy, they told each other. Oh, you mean THAT one?! Ooooh! Like the final scene from \u201cAn Officer And A Gentleman.\u201d Pretty funny.",

    "context": "Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats.\nThe election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November.\nThe race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.\n\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\" Trump warned the crowd.\nThough Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally.\nRepublicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains.\nIn making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.\n\nBut Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November.\n\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn. You don't really notice it as it is happening. And later in the day you realize, 'I'm red. I was out in the sun too long!' So, this takes a long period of time.\"",

    "context": "Jonathan Swift said, \u201cEverybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.\u201d  Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process.\nSo, our question for today is:\nWhat are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life \u2013 although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life.\nWhat has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, heart diseases, etc.\nThat alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that.\nUnfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. \u2013 basically empty calories.\nObesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole.\nThere is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries \u2013 it\u2019s easier and tastier.",

Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task.\nIn Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle.\nThis correspondent \u2014 an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers \u2014 has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state.\nRarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum.

Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams.\nCries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm.\nDuring the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die.\nAs the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.\nAt the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames.\n\"Form around them,\" called the leader of Roland's party.\nRoland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders.

That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported.\n\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\" the statement added.\nThe new figures still amount to a sharp decline.\nAfghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified.\nSenior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.\nThose success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nBut the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says.\nTrump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country.\nThe U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to a VOA analysis of monthly data released by the Pentagon.",

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled \u2018Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination\u2019. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: \u201cI would like filmmakers interested in thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d to recognize that they can benefit from being placed \u201cinside a box.\u201d I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to \u2018think more creatively\u2019. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states \u201ca genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work\u201d.\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and encouraged them to become more experimental as each student wanted to make their own \u2018personal film\u2019 and not the same kind of film as each of the other students. As many students stated it would have been much more difficult to make a film WITHOUT constraints than with. For it would have increased both the overwhelming options and the associated anxiety.",

Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters.

A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van.

She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

    "context": "The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nThe measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\"\nThe proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\nDespite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \"try and stay away\" from the Justice Department, but \"at some point, I won't.\"\nSupporters of the Special Counsel bill hailed it as a victory for the rule of law and said it would send a message that the president doesn't have unfettered authority.",

These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action.\n\"It's better to use the legislative process,\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday.\nBut that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn\u2019t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it\u2019s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/\u00a3millions.\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join \u201cnetworks\u201d and \u201ccommittees\u201d discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people \u2013 practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\nCentral to much of the impact is \u201caccess\u201d. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him.

Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and \u201cbully #1\u201d.\nBully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me.\nBully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style.\nOn this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.\nI was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning.\nI spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her:\n\u201cWhat do you know about Machiavellianism?\u201d\nI swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter.\nWhen #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, \u201cI'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.\u201d\nAnd I did.\nIt was noon.

After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails.

How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English. And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives.\nThe goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.\nOctober 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture.\nIf you\u2019re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture archives in California and would like to become involved with CalArchNet, you can join the Google group or email calarchnet@gmail.com for more information.

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.",

It\u2019s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy\u2019s southern heel and involves my daughter\u2019s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco\u2019s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family\u2019s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. \u201cHe was no adonis,\u201d noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed.\nWhen Anna\u2019s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter\u2019s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto \u2014 Mario, Marco\u2019s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War \u2014 but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work.\nNonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as \u201csugo di nonna Anna\u201d and, oddly, \u201camatriciana\u201d (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta).\nBut these polpette \u2013 plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia \u2013 were passed down to Anna\u2019s daughter in law, Angela\u2019s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law, Franca, Riccardo\u2019s wife, who continues to make them today for her own grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It has become this Tuscan family\u2019s recipe, spread throughout the branches of the family tree, made for guests and special occasions especially (it feeds a crowd wonderfully).",

For instance, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it\u2019s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or \u201ccomplete physical.\u201d\nLast but not least, blood testing is usually \u2014 although not always \u2014 very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.\nFatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things.\nConfused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more.\nLike much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults.\nHistorically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.\nIn fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)\nThis way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older adults.\nSpecifically, I\u2019ll cover four \u201cpanels\u201d which are commonly ordered, and then I\u2019ll list six more blood tests that I find especially useful.",

    "context": "Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The human digestive tract makes all the enzymes needed for digestion.",

Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts.

As I reeled from this waiting for my brain to catch up and make sense of everything, THWACK she did it again.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \"Dog paddle,\" and we all laughed. \"Tiger paddle,\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them.\nOur swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake.\nI liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.",

    "context": "Patch's mother was named Silver, because high summer sun made her fur shine that colour. She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there.\nHe could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near.\nPatch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.\nPatch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed.\n\"Hello, Patch,\" Brighteyes said weakly. \"Would you like to come in?\"\nPatch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded.",

And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision.\n\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor.\nThe boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left.

    "context": "As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \"outdated and unduly harsh\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country\u2019s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\nLast Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations \u2014 more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria apply for sentence commutations.",

Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on.\nThe city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there.

There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.\nNo doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign.

For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.",

Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

    "context": "For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.\nThe training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period.",

Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain.\nProblem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.\nI chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I\u2019ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.",

There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April.\nTrump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State.\n\"I have a simple message for them,\" Trump said. \"Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. But they will be gone. And soon.\"\nBut Clinton said Trump's presidency would have the opposite effect.\n\u201cA Trump presidency would embolden ISIS,\u201d she said referring to the group also known as Islamic State.\nThe two presidential candidates have presented very different approaches to terrorism, which experts like Goodman believe would likely produce different results.",

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20\u2019s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints.\nThere was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, \u201c He will die before morning. \u201c\nI suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

    "context": "The Getty Villa is a museum unlike any in the world. It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.",

Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day).

When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.",

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines.

Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on.\nThe city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there.

There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.\nNo doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign.

You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you\u2019d like.

To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending.

The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.)\nThe decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue.\n\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\"\nThe report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do.\n\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading the effort. \"Crucial to this effort is helping former prisoners find jobs.\"\n\"Nobody wins when former prisoners fail to adjust to life outside, or worse, end up back behind bars,\" Trump said.",

    "context": "To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle.\nThere is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction.\nIn addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges \u2013 including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression.\nPractices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being\nAccept Your Feelings\nStuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don\u2019t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them \u2013 especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\nDon\u2019t stuff your emotions!\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand \u2013 not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature\u2019s way of releasing stress.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do.\nWhile my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house.\nFrom that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked.\nYears later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term.\nAnd then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet.\nThroughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it. With the Internet I had found mine - and it was a doozy.",

Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.",

And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much.\nIn the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.",

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work?

Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the \u201cimpact industry\u201d; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study authors, etc., that have become embedded in the academy.",

In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let\u2019s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces\u2026.\nAlthough the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different \u2013 MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here.\nMAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil \u2013 this is the first lip pencil that I\u2019ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I\u2019m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it\u2019s not sticky.\nThe colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a \u2018soft plum with pearl\u2019. It\u2019s definitely a plummy shade, although I can\u2019t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it\u2019s very sheer it appears much more natural once it\u2019s on the lips. It\u2019s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you\u2019re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm!\nThe crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it\u2019s quick and easy, and as it\u2019s very light and sheer it\u2019s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.",

The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate:\nThat is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them.\nMusic is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops \u2013 often on instruments like a wheelie bin \u2013 and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. \u201cWe were rehearsing in another room, and I said: \u2018This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,\u2019\u201d Krzysztof recalls. \u201cSo we burst into their office \u2013 they were a bit alarmed \u2013 and I said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve just got to sing this song to you.\u2019\u201d The song was \u201cMedia Vita\u201d, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof.

People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage.\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother?\nMaybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened. But he had moved out of the house during his first semester at Lamar University--even though it was only forty minutes away, in Beaumont. A fellow music major had been more than happy to let Greg share the little rent house and the expenses.\nRalph Tenorly had sent his wife to the grocery store for more chips and dip.

Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad.

It\u2019s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy\u2019s southern heel and involves my daughter\u2019s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco\u2019s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family\u2019s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. \u201cHe was no adonis,\u201d noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed.\nWhen Anna\u2019s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter\u2019s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto \u2014 Mario, Marco\u2019s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War \u2014 but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work.\nNonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as \u201csugo di nonna Anna\u201d and, oddly, \u201camatriciana\u201d (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta).\nBut these polpette \u2013 plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia \u2013 were passed down to Anna\u2019s daughter in law, Angela\u2019s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law, Franca, Riccardo\u2019s wife, who continues to make them today for her own grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing.\nKey to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).",

To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence.

    "context": "Another phone call at just after three. He answered on the third ring.\n\"Is this Mr. Ray--uh. . .\" The sound of shuffling papers.\n\"Yes.\"\nThe voice brightened perceptibly, strapped on a mask of friendliness. \"My name is John Donovan. I'm an attorney representing the family of Donald Ackerman. I'm sorry to be calling so late.\"\n\"It's not late for me.\"\nA laugh, intended to sound nervous or flustered. To Ray, it only sounded false. \"That's right, of course. Only late for me. Do you mind if I tape record this conversation?\"\nSmooth segue, meant to catch him off guard, startle him into acceptance.\n\"Yes, I do mind. Can I help you?\" You fucking bastard.\nJohn Donovan paused on his end of the line. Ray imagined him reaching for a legal pad upon which to take notes (just as he was supposed to imagine), though, of course, the tape recorder was still running.\n\"Um, I was wondering if I could get some information?\"\n\"Sir, federal law prohibits me from acknowledging either to confirm or deny the presence of the individual of whom you have spoken or his participation in our program.\"\nRay grinned.\n\"Very well done,\" the lawyer said. \"I guess that sets the parameters.\"\n\"I guess it does.\"\n\"Were you working two nights ago.\"\n\"Sir, I am bound by Center policy and state law from discussing with you the work schedule of our employees at this facility unless you are an officer of the law or bearing a subpoena, in which case, I am only authorized to refer you to my supervisor.\"\nRay grinned again. He was enjoying this.\n\"What if I told you I have possession of a subpoena?\"\n\"Have you spoken to our attorney?\" Ray countered.\n\"In fact, son, yes I have. This afternoon.\"\nRay grunted. Standard level of communication. \"That's good, because I haven't. Which means, of course, that I'm not prepared to talk to you at all until advised on my statement by legal counsel.\"",

    "context": "For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don\u2019t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps.\nI started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual.\nWhen I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don\u2019t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly.\n1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT)\nRecognise the gift your body is giving you.\nMy belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone.\n2. FORGIVENESS\nAcknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.\nI am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly.\n3. GRATITUDE\nNotice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it.\nI am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that\u2019s it\u2019s not too late to take great care of you.",

    "context": "Overnight the clouds had rolled in and the summer was dead. I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain.\nSomebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \"Busy?\" he asked.\nI shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him. He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me.\n\"Big shakeup last night,\" he said. \"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\"\n\"So they finally got to him,\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \"How'd they do it?\"\n\"It's very hush-hush,\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\"\n\"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\"\nHe nodded. \"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\"\nA sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up.\n\"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\"\n\"It's probably bill collectors,\" I said. \"I'll yell if they get rough.\"\nHe opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside.\nThey were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache.",

    "context": "SEOUL \u2014 The annual U.S.\u2013South Korea joint military exercises currently underway have historically been a very public demonstration of force intended, in part, to counter North Korea\u2019s aggressive nuclear and missile tests. But with looming diplomatic summits aimed at reaching a deal to end the North\u2019s nuclear program, media coverage of the drills has so far been limited.\nThis week, the U.S. Second Infantry Division held a public tree planting ceremony at Camp Casey in South Korea, near the inter-Korean border.\n\u201cIt is my belief that this tree, like those that have come before it, shall symbolize the roots that bind us together, and to our past in an enduring way,\u201d said General Jon Howerton, the deputy commander of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, at the event.\nThe journalists attending the tree ceremony were also permitted to watch a shooting competition to determine the best marksmen in the participating U.S. and South Korean divisions.\nThe Camp Casey event was one of the few joint military training activities that news organizations have, so far, been allowed to cover, and it illustrates how the United States and South Korea are downplaying the offensive component of this year\u2019s combined exercises.\n\u201cThis is clearly in order to send a signal to North Korea that South Korea and the United States are not willing to escalate the situation any further,\u201d said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst with the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\nThis year\u2019s Foal Eagle and Key Resolve combined military exercises are similar in scale to past drills, with more than 23,000 U.S. troops and 300,000 South Korean forces engaging in joint battlefield maneuvers, and responding to computer-simulated attacks from North Korea.\nBut the start of the drills was delayed this year at South Korea\u2019s request to set a peaceful tone for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South and to facilitate the North\u2019s participation in the games.",
