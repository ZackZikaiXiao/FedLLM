    "context": "I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and \u201cAwful Awfuls\u201d at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes.\nOne day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order.\n\u201cHi, How are you today?\u201d, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. \u201cWhat may I get you?\u2026..\u201d Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!\nThe ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of \u201csyncope, unknown origin\u201d. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill!\nHere\u2019s the Garden City location, where I worked.",

One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nLast month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied.\nChina gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal.\nBeijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.\n\nIn other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland.

It\u2019s rare to see an instructor be emotional but it was something that brought reality into the room for us. The candidate was given 24 hours to call the hospital, talk to his wife, learn more of the situation and make a decision. He ended up staying in the pipeline and graduated.

Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other.

He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \"Did it get either of you?\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \"No\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \"Are you hurt?\" \"Mm...My hand.\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \"Did he claw you or bite you?\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \"He bit me.\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures.

An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \"Did it get either of you?\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \"No\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \"Are you hurt?\" \"Mm...My hand.\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \"Did he claw you or bite you?\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \"He bit me.\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground.",

    "context": "I recall just one case of its kind.\nIn my first year out of high school in college, I didn\u2019t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise.\nThe next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn\u2019t over - yet.\nFast forward some 45\u201360 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. \u201cHis car crashed.\u201d, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut.\nBut as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights.\nThe van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving.\nBasically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.",

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about \u201cdine and dash.\u201d\nWe all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me?\n\u201cRyan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.\u201d He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip.\nShe made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night.\nNeedless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.",

I learned from this mistake and have taken every precaution to prevent it from happening again. She was uninjured luckily, but I was freaking traumatized. I have a SUUUUPPPPEEEERRR long driveway, so I usually drive my truck to the end to check my mail, and on this particular day, I was out in my yard playing with Roxie, I saw the mailman drive by through my fence, and so we walked back to the house, I grabbed my keys, and off we went. This wasn't too long ago, maybe May, so it's hot, typical North Carolina weather, maybe 92 and some change, so my windows are down, because I drive a 13 year old black truck, so it's hot as hell, and it makes it hard to breathe. The AC works, it just takes time to kick in, and number 5 (my highest AC setting) does not work. As I'm driving down, I'm going maybe 5 miles an hour. I'm petting Roxie with my right hand when I feel her jerk out of my reach and I hear a bush rustle, I look to the passenger side, slam on brakes (because the last thing I want is to hurt my baby) and put the truck in park. Sure enough, my mom and her Chihuahua were out in the front yard, and Roxie, being her playful self jumped out and ran. She scared the absolute shit out of me, so now when I drive with her in the car, the window stays shut or cracked. Lesson learned.",

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has assailed Comey as a \"showboat'' and a \"liar.''",

Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.",

It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\"\nTrump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy.\nDaniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted $130,000 from Trump attorney Cohen to stay quiet.",

The chairs in the waiting room are leather and the copy machine has a million attachments and there's pictures on the wall that I don't know what they're supposed to be.

Red hair and freckles and shiny skin that looks like she just got out of a hot shower. A smile like she really means it. My name was in the book and she showed me right on in. Dennis shook my hand and put me in a chair that was slings and tube steel. The calendar next to his desk had a ski scene on it. Behind him was solid books, law books all in the same binding, also some biographies and political stuff. \"Too bad you couldn't make the reunion,\" Dennis said. \"It was a hoot.\" \"I just felt weird about it,\" I said. I still did. It looked like he wanted me to go on, so I said, \"I knew there'd be a bunch of y'all there that had really made good, and I guess I...I don't know. Didn't want to have to make excuses.\" \"Hard to believe it's been twenty years. You look good. I still wouldn't want to run into you in a dark alley, but you look fit. In shape.\" \"I got weights in the garage, I try to work out. When you're my size you can go to hell pretty quick.

The chairs in the waiting room are leather and the copy machine has a million attachments and there's pictures on the wall that I don't know what they're supposed to be. Made me ashamed of the shirt I was wearing, the cuffs all frayed and some of the buttons don't match. The secretary is a knockout and I figure Dennis has got to be getting in her pants. Red hair and freckles and shiny skin that looks like she just got out of a hot shower. A smile like she really means it. My name was in the book and she showed me right on in. Dennis shook my hand and put me in a chair that was slings and tube steel. The calendar next to his desk had a ski scene on it. Behind him was solid books, law books all in the same binding, also some biographies and political stuff. \"Too bad you couldn't make the reunion,\" Dennis said. \"It was a hoot.\" \"I just felt weird about it,\" I said. I still did. It looked like he wanted me to go on, so I said, \"I knew there'd be a bunch of y'all there that had really made good, and I guess I...I don't know. Didn't want to have to make excuses.\" \"Hard to believe it's been twenty years. You look good. I still wouldn't want to run into you in a dark alley, but you look fit.

    "context": "So this thing happened today.\nI am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads.\nBTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month.\n(Source)\nAs she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity.\nBut the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.\nSo this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.\nBut my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.\nIf the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us.\nSometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.",

    "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government\u2019s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses.\nIn his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had \u201cfully reimbursed\u201d his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of $100,000 to $250,000 in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier.\nTrump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on the OGE\u2019s letter to charge that Trump\u2019s earlier omission of the payment could amount to a violation of federal laws on financial disclosures.",

Out climbed this tall fellow, dressed like God's grandpa done up for a wedding or a funeral. His skin was brown as a buckwheat cake, with creases deep as drainage ditches. Took a mighty long stretch of sweat and toil, love and birth and dying, to carve a face like that. He flexed his shoulders, then rolled his neck till it cracked. He pulled a pack of Camel straights from inside his vest and flipped one out. \"Got a light?\" His voice was deep and warm, half gravel, half honey. I tossed him a pack of matches through the open door; he caught it left-handed, then flipped it open, folded over a match, and struck it with his thumb. \"This the town with the dead fiddler?\" he said after a long drag on the smoke. \"You might say so,\" I said, ignoring the look Harnie gave me. Nobody talked about her; I wondered how this fellow had even heard about her. \"Ain't a fiddle, though. It's a cello, like in the symphony.\" The stranger shrugged. \"Close enough.\" \"She ain't d-dead, neither,\" Harnie said. \"M-more sleeping, like.\" He puffed out a wreath of smoke.

    "context": "The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nThe measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\"\nThe proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\nDespite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \"try and stay away\" from the Justice Department, but \"at some point, I won't.\"\nSupporters of the Special Counsel bill hailed it as a victory for the rule of law and said it would send a message that the president doesn't have unfettered authority.",

Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa.\n\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group.\nOften lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms.\nThere are the \"preppers,\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest.\nThere are the \"survivalists,\" people who learn skills to \u201clive off the land\u201d in case of a disaster.\nThere are \u201csovereign citizens\u201d such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow.\nAnd then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.\nThe modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nAmong them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\"\nUnder Clinton, the number of anti-government groups soared but it fell during President George W. Bush's two terms before peaking at 1,360 under President Barack Obama.",

I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That\u2019s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the \u201cnice sweatshirt\u201d bit was what really got me.\nI wasn\u2019t even wearing my sweatshirt.\nSo. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don\u2019t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name.\n\u201cHey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!\u201d I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt\u2019s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of \u201ctry not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling\u201d. I wasn\u2019t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan\u2019s.\nIt\u2019s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I\u2019ve gotten from a stranger all year. Complimented on something that wasn\u2019t even mine\u2026 Welcome to my life, everybody!",

    "context": "His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.",

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home.\n\nFor Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains.\nFrom the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries.\n\n\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement.\nIt was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize.\n\n\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\"\n\nIt was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague.\n\nThe United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue.",

    "context": "When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it.

    "context": "In this confessional age, TV, radio and print rely for much of their content on the sad stories of those 'victims' of life. The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails. Take your pick: they were molested, their parents ran away from home, they were denied desserts except on Sundays. Just thinking about it brings a tear to my stony face. How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English. And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim.\nTrump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally.\nThose numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president\u2019s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.",

So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain.\nProblem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.\nI chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I\u2019ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.",

    "context": "In this confessional age, TV, radio and print rely for much of their content on the sad stories of those 'victims' of life. The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails. Take your pick: they were molested, their parents ran away from home, they were denied desserts except on Sundays. Just thinking about it brings a tear to my stony face. How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English. And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages. As it turns out for my siblings and I, this was not to be the case.",

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\nWhat might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become \u201csituation normal\u201d for the man elected as the nation\u2019s 45th chief executive.\nTrump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\u201cIt was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,\u201d said Trump with Merkel looking on. \u201cIt is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.\u201d\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in \u201csecret meetings and communications\u201d between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\nEarlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders.\n\u201cHe is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,\u201d Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.\nTrump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation.\nThere were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional scrutiny of embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt, under fire for allegedly misspending government funds.",

    "context": "President Donald Trump often likes to point out how different he is from his White House predecessors in terms of style and substance. But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\nOn Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner.\nThe two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings.\nThe only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\n\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl.\nAfter a pause, the president responded. \"Stupid question,\" he said dismissively.\nCohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied.\nTrump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\nEarlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House.\n\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\"\nSeveral legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president.\n\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\" said George Washington University Law Professor Paul Schiff Berman.",

    "context": "I have always been a \u201chandyman\u201d involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle.\nWhen the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a \u201crage\u201d of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\" I said, \"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\"\nI learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.",

We must not allow them to succeed.\u201d\nCongressional inquiries also continue.

    "context": "I have always been a \u201chandyman\u201d involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle.\nWhen the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a \u201crage\u201d of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\" I said, \"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\"\nI learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.",

    "context": "WHITE HOUSE \u2014 The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday.\nThe U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone.\nChina's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision.\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \"are over'\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \"highly restrictive\" trade practices.\nTrump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors.\n\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \"They're critical for national security.\"\nBut the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce.\nEuropean Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization.\n\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\" said Malmstrom.\nWithout elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \"rebalancing measures,\" which typically are retaliatory actions.\nTrudeau called the tariffs \"totally unacceptable\" and vowed retaliation.\n\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is a mistake in many respects,\" said French President Emmanuel Macron, warning that \"economic nationalism leads to war.\"\nFrance's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who met Ross earlier on Thursday, said the U.S. shouldn't see global trade like the Wild West or the \"gunfight at the O.K. Corral.\"",

    "context": "President Donald Trump made a fresh appeal Friday for support to arm some teachers to help stem mass shootings targeting schools.\n\nTrump's pitch came during a speech before a friendly conservative crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting near Washington.\n\nTrump spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Although a new experience for Trump, it is a situation many of his predecessors are all too familiar with.\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all faced similar tragedies while in office. They also dealt with political pressures in the aftermath demanding action.\n\nTrump is also beginning to see why presidents are often frustrated when they try to bridge what pollsters and political pundits often refer to as the great divide over guns in the United States.\n\nIn the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Clinton sought to calm the nation. \"We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons,\" he said.\n\nIn 2007, it was left to President Bush to lead the grieving at Virginia Tech after a gunman killed 32 people before committing suicide. \"May God bless and keep the souls of the lost, and may his love touch all of those who suffer in grief,\" he said at an on campus memorial service.\n\nAnd in 2012, an emotional President Obama wiped away a tear as he addressed the nation in the wake of the massacre of grade-school students in Newtown, Connecticut. \"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the last few years. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old,\" he said.\nTrump has expressed sympathy for the victims and families in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But he has also been forceful in pushing for solutions, including the controversial idea of arming some teachers.",

    "context": "Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.",

He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \"Hook her up,\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \"I said hook her up,\" Dorian said. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said for the third time. \"I said hook her up!\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney.

His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \"Hook her up,\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \"I said hook her up,\" Dorian said. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said for the third time. \"I said hook her up!\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney. Coffee stain or no coffee stain, Dorian was a commanding presence.",

She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.",

Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats.\nThe losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year.

One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time.\nI was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen.\nIf I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims.\nI have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented.\nI now understand where there talent comes from\u2026\nShame on them.",

    "context": "The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump.\nMoore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14.\n\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.\n\nJones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate.\n\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\" Jones said.\nTrump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday.\n\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\" he said.\nTrump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him.\n\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\" Trump said.\nIn the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda.\n\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\" Moore said.\n\nDemocrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\"",

Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction.\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.\n\nThey also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\"\n\nSome of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.\n\n\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \"without a warrant.\"",

He was heartbroken, crestfallen, that he lost something he cherished from his military service\u2014the symbolic military issue Bausch & Lombs coveted by every officer who served.\nI wanted so badly to be my dad\u2019s Hero. I overturned every piece of furniture in the house, rifled every dresser drawer, every nook and crannie, underneath beds, the garage, the yard, you name it. I was on a Mission. I wanted to walk up to him and say, beaming, Here Dad! I found your sunglasses! But alas, after several weeks, no success. I was crushed by my own failure.\nHe passed away, and his possessions were divided among our family.\nFast forward to a few years ago. My Cocker Spaniel was sniffing around in the bathroom, and a box fell out of the bathroom closet with a crash. I went to investigate and chide the dog\u2026when the first thing I saw on the bathroom floor next to the overturned box was the yellowed leather case, and his wire rim sunglasses. I picked it up, held it in my hand, and I, a grown man, immediately burst into tears, sobbing. Suddenly, I was nineteen again. My wife asked what was the matter, and I told her the whole story.\nI figured after his passing, his sunglasses\u2014which evidently were in the house the whole time\u2014were probably tossed into one of many anonymous cardboard boxes, and I happened to be the one who carried off the box containing them.\nSo here Dad! I found your sunglasses! I love you! Am I still your hero?",

    "context": "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said a ruling in favor of the Republican districting plan in Wisconsin would encourage others to stack the deck against their political opponents. \u201cWhat becomes of the precious right to vote?\u201d Ginsburg asked during the one-hour session.",

We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people\u2019s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn\u2019t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, \u201cwell Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.\u201d This fellow student knew I didn\u2019t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week\u2019s assignment.

Even funnier was the fact that this week\u2019s assignment required 6\u20137 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any \u2018after school help!\u2019\nThis was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough.

When I was in middle school, if you didn\u2019t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for \u2018after school help.\u2019 It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter.\nNow, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people\u2019s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn\u2019t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, \u201cwell Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.\u201d This fellow student knew I didn\u2019t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week\u2019s assignment. He looks it over and says \u201cOK, good job\u201d or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week\u2019s assignment required 6\u20137 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any \u2018after school help!\u2019\nThis was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough. I know none of that is allowed these days, but those were both good deterrents for me!!",

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a \u201cgiant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.\u201d\nTrump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.\nSenate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors.\nDemocrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol.\nOn the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported.\n\u201cWe are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,\u201d Moore said in his victory speech.\nMoore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12.\nTrump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it.\n\u201cTrump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,\u201d said Republican strategist John Feehery.\n\nMoore\u2019s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next year\u2019s midterm congressional elections.",

When this started, I thought it\u2019s something to do with what I had previously eaten which was stale and was having a reaction to bad food. When the problem persisted for a week where I was barely able to keep my food from coming out, I went to visit my doctor. He asked me questions and gave me some vitamins and pills before and after food to stop the vomiting. They didn\u2019t work. Even though I was not sexually active, I got my self a pregnancy test which showed negitive.\nI tried to eat healthy, but to no avail. 15 mins was the max my food was inside my stomach. I was becoming weak from all the throwing up and rapidly loosing weight. I went to my doctor again and he said I was stressed. Wrote me some more pills. Nothing worked. My Mom got paranoid and took me to another doctor for a second opinion. The doctor asked me to write down everything I ate with the number of times I threw up for the next 2 days and return to his clinic.\nOnly then, were they able to diagnose that I was lactose intolerant!! Milk, milk products, cheese, butter, cream, nothing seems to agree with my stomach anymore. Surprisingly this is what I used to eat - cereals with milk, eggs with butter, pizza, pasta, lasagne, cheese with bread, tall long glasses of iced coffee, frappes and bam, my body would reject them within 15 minutes. It was terrible switching from coffee with milk to black coffee, until I started developing a taste for it. Pizza\u2019s are something I still can\u2019t eat. I need to remove the cheese from the slice and unfortunately my body is able to only take one slice of Pizza. Pasta, white sauce is a strict no no unless I want to feel bloated and throw up. So yep.

It\u2019s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples.\nFor years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as \u201cbeeping.\u201d Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were.\nWhen they got worse and I couldn\u2019t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn\u2019t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them.\nI\u2019ve been on them for a few years now, and it\u2019s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I\u2019m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don\u2019t like being behind the wheel), I don\u2019t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It\u2019s the greatest gift I\u2019ve given to myself.\nYou know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don\u2019t know yourself.

I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around. She said \u201cNo, Mom, you can be dead-assed broke and the world is still going to go around.\u201d\nThat was when I quit letting money be a burden.",

Almoost every day he would send me some sort of message.\n\u201cWhat do you pray about?\u201d I don\u2019t.\n\u201cGod loves you, he gave his son for you, why don\u2019t you love Him?\u201d Because I don\u2019t believe He or his Son exist.\n\u201cWhat are you going to say when you die and stand before Satan instead of God?\u201d Missed that by a mile, didn\u2019t I?\nThis went on for a few months. His questions became increasing unhinged and the only thing that mattered to him were his beliefs. Mine were of no consequence. I had asked him, politely at first and then more assertively, to stop bombarding me with his attempts to convert me or to witness to me. All to no avail.\nFinally, I\u2019d had enough and decided I had better things to do. I pulled the plug and unfriended Scott. He\u2019s sent me several friend requests over the years, all of which I have summarily ignored.",

I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain.\nSomebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \"Busy?\" he asked.\nI shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him. He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me.\n\"Big shakeup last night,\" he said. \"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\"\n\"So they finally got to him,\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \"How'd they do it?\"\n\"It's very hush-hush,\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\"\n\"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\"\nHe nodded. \"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\"\nA sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up.\n\"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\"\n\"It's probably bill collectors,\" I said. \"I'll yell if they get rough.\"\nHe opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside.\nThey were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache.",

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter.\nThe very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on.\nThe city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's.\nI had an idea.\nI made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up.\nNow on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.\nNo doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign.

    "context": "One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa\u2019s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display.\nBringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask\u2014and answer\u2014several questions about it. Who\u2014if anyone\u2014does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history.\nIn its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object\u2019s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation.\nIn early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display.\nAfter the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a closer look at the curious origin and function of this sculpture type.",

    "context": "The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas.\nA series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas.\nThe diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \"population sets\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S.\nEven if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial.\nIt is the first evidence of a plan for the \"extreme vetting\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign.\nThe four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \"population sets\" requiring more scrutiny.\nBut in the first glimpse into what \"extreme vetting\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years.\nThe questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency.\nThe directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \"They could provide a pretext for barring individuals based on their nonviolent beliefs and expression. Social media checks, as well as demands for social media passwords at U.S. borders, have significant implications for privacy and freedom of expression.''",

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney\u2019s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.",

    "context": "LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON \u2014 As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives.\nCalifornia's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts.\nMarijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia.\nMarijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue.\nVoters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales.\nCalifornians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nWashington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others.\nCalifornians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.\nTwenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.\nSouth Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing the task from legislators, said by critics to be self-interested.\nThe minimum wage could get a boost in South Dakota, Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington state. And voters in California will uphold or reject a state law that bans single-use plastic bags, which many consider an environmental hazard.",

Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge.

Uncle Arehl (I don't know precisely whose uncle he is, or for what the two initials of his name once stood) saunters slowly across a dry, patchy lawn, and the camera follows him. For some reason I'm more interested in the lawn--if it can be called that--than in the people on it. The sun in the movie is blazing, and everyone filmed looks only briefly at the camera before averting their faces once again to look at the stubbly grass. The camera pans once again and I can see an incredibly rutted path leading from the porch to the fence at the edge of the yard, broken pieces of concrete amid deep tire tracks fossilized in sun-baked mud. The fence is low, wire like a chain-link, but lower, with metal stakes holding it up instead of tubes.",

    "context": "For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives.\nThe goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.\nOctober 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture.\nIf you\u2019re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture archives in California and would like to become involved with CalArchNet, you can join the Google group or email calarchnet@gmail.com for more information. The Spring 2018 meeting will be held in San Luis Obispo.",

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. \u201cIf our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,\u201d she says, \u201cthe medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.\u201d\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes\u2019 unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including globalization and multiculturalism,\u201d she adds.",

This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap.\nWhile at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits:\n* Direction \u2013 one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle.\n* Documented commitments are more effective \u2013 a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project.\n* Feeling of success \u2013 regularly revisiting a roadmap and checking off items that have been completed can develop a strong feeling of progress and success.

This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap.\nWhile at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits:\n* Direction \u2013 one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle.\n* Documented commitments are more effective \u2013 a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project.\n* Feeling of success \u2013 regularly revisiting a roadmap and checking off items that have been completed can develop a strong feeling of progress and success. It makes a team feel productive.",

    "context": "Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter:\n\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source technology and approaches.",

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy.\nThis latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA.\nThe U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public.\nThe late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\"\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user \u2014 all without judicial oversight.\nThe FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \"a typo\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \"a very, very big and practical way.\"\nBut a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations.\n\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing \u2018a typo' in the law,\u201d the letter said. \"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online activities without court oversight.\"\nIt was signed by Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and others.",

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source\u2019s ecosystem.\nI am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.\nI find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said \u2018M$\u2019 instead of \u2018MS\u2019 (ugh.)\nThings have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me.\nThings have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don\u2019t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt.\nStill though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them?\nA little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft\u2019s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce proprietary software and use software patents in departments such as Windows and Office.",

I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word.\nSome have described us not meeting the goal as a \u201cfailure\u201d. I don\u2019t see it that way. Let\u2019s be honest: $32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn\u2019t come cheap (and remember that the $32million didn\u2019t include any costs for software engineering and project management\u2026Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though.\nI am not surprised that we didn\u2019t hit this ambitious $32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more. Every single person who put their support into the Ubuntu Edge campaign should be proud of their achievements and we are all thankful for your tremendous and inspiring support.\nOne thing to be critically clear about is that the Ubuntu convergence story does not end here. We are as voraciously excited and committed to bringing this Free Software convergence story to the world as ever before; our work with OEMs, Carriers, and ISVs continues apace. We have fantastic work going on across all fronts, and we are on track to have a 1.0 release of the Ubuntu Phone platform in October.",

    "context": "In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University.\nMembers of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana.\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.'''\nAlso leading the charge Monday were Trump\u2019s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.''\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \"It's wrong and I hope he stops.''\nBut no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border.\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\nDemocratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \"are just plain despicable.\"\nVela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 \u2014 well before Trump's ancestors.\nVela wrote, \"Mr. Trump you are a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it\u2026.\"\nKasich, Rubio and Collins joined other top Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who all condemned Trump's remarks on Sunday.",

They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it.\nHe knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.\nFrom behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown.\nA shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.",

When she was a child, her faith was preached and practiced openly all over the south of France. The crusade was already twenty years old then, but the perfecti still taught crowds of people in the streets of great cities like Toulouse and Beziers, still won converts away from the Church of Rome.

    "context": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don\u2019t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same \u2018ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.",

    "context": "Today, many academics feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. They\u2019re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others \u2013 and that\u2019s because over the years, they\u2019ve developed personal \u201csystems\u201d to help them write.\nWe recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko \u2013 a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common \u201chabits\u201d that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use.\n1. They \u201ctime-block\u201d their writing in advance\nScheduling \u2013 booking in time to write in advance \u2013 was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn\u2019t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing \u2013 and so made the process easier and less stressful.\n\u201cWhen I need to write I block out time. I\u2019m lucky in that I can work from home \u2013 I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn\u2019t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.\u201d",

    "context": "It has become increasingly common for academics to use social media to communicate with wider audiences. Twitter, like many other social platforms, typically measures success in terms of numbers of followers, likes and retweets, but this only tells us something about the spreading of messages but not necessarily whether the content of the messages is understood or embraced. One way to ascertain this is through network and language analysis, which, used together, can tell us how effective the communication is.\nEconomists tweet less, mention fewer people and have fewer conversations with strangers than a comparable group of experts in the sciences, and use less accessible language with words that are more complex, with more abbreviations and with a more distant tone. Their tweets are less personal and less inclusive than those used by scientists.\nThis is what appeared in April 2017 when we gathered data on tens of thousands of tweets from the Twitter accounts of both the top 25 economists and 25 scientists as identified by IDEAS and Science, including the top three economists at the time, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Erik Brynjolfsson and, on the other side, the top three scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, and Richard Dawkins. At that time those accounts covered roughly two thirds of all the following.\nThe timing is significant because 2016 has been declared the year of post-truth politics, the year in which appeals to emotions (pathos) superseded the significance of factual evidence-based information (logos), affecting people\u2019s constructions and interpretations of events. This has been accompanied by the growing prominence of political \u201calt\u201d movements (e.g. UKIP, the Alt-right) and their aggressive, provocative, and populist narratives, and \u201cfake news\u201d leading to political shock events such as Brexit and the Trump election.\nThe relatively low traction of economists in these public debates has been and continues to be an important issue. Does the public not trust economists? Don\u2019t they understand what economists do and how they work? Is their work misrepresented in the media? And how do economists themselves interact with public opinion?",

    "context": "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 The conservative leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party on Thursday spoke out against the upcoming U.S.\u2013North Korea summit. He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cI am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,\u201d said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party.\nOn June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North\u2019s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953.\nMany South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country\u2019s trade, and the threat of military action.\nBut they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North\u2019s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief.\nHong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later.\nTrump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 election. Trump has strongly denied any allegations of collision with Moscow and has called the investigation a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him.\nI do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane.\nUnder his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night.\nWas my pledge to Nicolette a lie?\nNo, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God.\nHe had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him.\nWhat if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette.\nAnd then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette.\nBut tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss.\nNot as long as I still love Diane.\nWhen he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily.",

    "context": "SEOUL \u2014 Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost $20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12.\n\u201cThe hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear long process,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.\nPresident Trump has said he expects a \"very positive result\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North\u2019s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\"\nThis position aligns closer to the Kim government\u2019s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals with North Korea and Ukraine\u2019s experience in dismantling its nuclear arsenal after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.",

    "context": "At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association\u2019s \u201cActivism in Sociology Forum\u201d members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda?\nI learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the \u201cimpact industry\u201d; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study authors, etc., that have become embedded in the academy.",

The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done.\nHe took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself.\nUnder the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I\u2019d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we \u201csee\u201d data.\nMy dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as \u201cpalaeobiologists\u201d \u2013 meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s time, palaeontology \u2013 especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record \u2013 involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy).

Let\u2019s examine the diet cycle mentality.\nTHERE IS A MAGIC CURE\nThe reason you haven\u2019t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven\u2019t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off.\nONE LAST DIET\nOnce you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body\u2019s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.\nYOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS\nYou really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat!\nI WANT TO BREAK FREE!!\nThe only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there.\nHe could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near.\nPatch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.\nPatch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed.\n\"Hello, Patch,\" Brighteyes said weakly. \"Would you like to come in?\"\nPatch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded.",

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps.\nI started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual.\nWhen I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don\u2019t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly.\n1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT)\nRecognise the gift your body is giving you.\nMy belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone.\n2. FORGIVENESS\nAcknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.\nI am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly.\n3. GRATITUDE\nNotice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it.\nI am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time.

POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT)\nRecognise the gift your body is giving you.\nMy belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone.\n2. FORGIVENESS\nAcknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.\nI am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly.\n3. GRATITUDE\nNotice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it.\nI am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time.

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel.\n\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up.\n\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.",

His country would be very rich.\u201d Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House.\nPresident Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants.\nBut the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North\u2019s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.",

Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you\u2019re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year\u2019s resolutions.\nFull disclaimer before we completely dive in: I\u2019m not against setting goals.

Some of the common resolutions we\u2019ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There\u2019s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and\u2026nothing changes.\nBy mid-January, they\u2019ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren\u2019t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that\u2019s what they have remained\u2026ideas.\nYou didn\u2019t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you\u2019re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you\u2019ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are?\nYou\u2019re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let\u2019s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year\u2019s resolutions when you should focus on two.",

    "context": "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program.\n\u201cBefore the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,\u201d said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University\u2019s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul.\nA year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery.\nMoon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea\u2019s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China\u2019s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration\u2019s talk of possible military action to end the North\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland.\nIn his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis.\nIn a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is \u201cthe absolute condition for peace.\u201d\nBut unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and offered only cooperation on humanitarian aid and exchanges. Seoul also balanced its outreach efforts with maintaining strong support for the U.S. alliance, for joint military deterrence, and for imposing increasingly harsh U.S.-led economic sanctions against North Korea.",

They think they\u2019re a very special case,\u201d Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.\nWhile the Iran deal limited that country\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.\nBut apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions.\nJohn Delury, a North Korea analyst with Yonsei University in Seoul, said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is insurmountable but it adds yet another layer of difficulty.\u201d\nIn some ways Pyongyang may be reassured that a deal reached with the Trump administration would likely be supported by the next administration to follow.",

In the end, we chose the latter.\nIf you have ever shared with friends or family that you\u2019re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, \u201cOh! I know a realtor I can recommend!\u201d Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well.\nI still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done.

Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn\u2019t mean you have to hire him/her. It\u2019s business and nobody should take it personally.\nInterviewing real estate agents just makes sense.\nOftentimes, people don\u2019t.\nWhy not just use the realtor that sold you the house you\u2019re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer\u2019s agent? Do you know if they\u2019ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won\u2019t hurt.",

British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday.

And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week.\nAnd with that, The Friday Thing was born.\nTo promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked journalists and the campaign was picked up by just about every major newspaper, local radio station and even made it on to the BBC.",

We\u2019re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house.\nThe following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you\u2019d like.

    "context": "Thanksgiving will be here before we know it! If you\u2019re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I\u2019d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you\u2019ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You\u2019ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for!\nI thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin.\nIt\u2019s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you\u2019re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions.\nIf you made these decorative pumpkins, and don\u2019t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We\u2019re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house.\nThe following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you\u2019d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.",

She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel.

We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again.\nJenny used the money to pay for her Master's.

Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA.\nA bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote \u201cstrikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,\u201d Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said \u201cthe strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.\u201d Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, \u201cOur whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.\u201d\nIf the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide $50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates.\nBut the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill\u2019s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate.\nIn a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization.\nJeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act \u201cwere anchored in falsehoods.\u201d\nHe added the legislation passed today \u201cis a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration\u201d a move also welcomed by many House Republicans.\n\u201cRather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, said, speaking of the bill\u2019s reform measures on the House floor Tuesday.",

    "context": "Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole.\nWe grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again.\nJenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much.\nJenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.",

I\u2019ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me.\nI am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don\u2019t take any action to stop the next one.\nI am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children.\nI am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations.\nI am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now.\nI am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this.\nI don\u2019t think we are, but that\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending if we don\u2019t force our government to do something.

Welcome to Florida in July. \ud83d\ude00 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside.\nI really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place \u2013 and by \u201croaming\u201d, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on.\nIn addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that\u2019s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don\u2019t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal.\nHemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping $8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool.\nToday, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It\u2019s a gorgeous piece of property but I\u2019m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.",

A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep.

    "context": "It\u2019s October, which means it\u2019s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time!\nBack when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)\nNot all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles.\nOr maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults?\nI\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.\nBut it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.\nSo I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.\nThis month, you\u2019ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I\u2019ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu\n* What to know about flu shots for older adults\n* What\u2019s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu season\n* Which influenza vaccination is probably best for most older adults\n* What to do if your older parent or relative is unwilling or unable to get vaccinated",

    "context": "It\u2019s October, which means it\u2019s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time!\nBack when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)\nNot all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles.\nOr maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults?\nI\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.\nBut it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.\nSo I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.\nThis month, you\u2019ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I\u2019ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu\n* What to know about flu shots for older adults\n* What\u2019s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu season\n* Which influenza vaccination is probably best for most older adults\n* What to do if your older parent or relative is unwilling or unable to get vaccinated",

Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more.\nLike much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults.\nHistorically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.\nIn fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)\nThis way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older adults.\nSpecifically, I\u2019ll cover four \u201cpanels\u201d which are commonly ordered, and then I\u2019ll list six more blood tests that I find especially useful.",

    "context": "Have you ever wondered whether it\u2019s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising?\nIn 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of \u201csuccessful aging\u201d health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.)\nDuring the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)?\nThat\u2019s right. When it came to avoiding \u201cmajor mobility disability\u201d \u2014 which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more \u2014 a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education.\nSpecifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program.\nThis is a very encouraging finding! That said, it\u2019s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.\nWant to know how often the exercisers experienced \u201cadverse events\u201d? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!)\nLet\u2019s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I\u2019ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers.\nWho were the study volunteers? Whenever you read about a research study, it\u2019s important to understand how the study volunteers compare to the older adults in *your* life. One of the many things I love about this study is that they purposefully enrolled older adults who were sedentary, and physically vulnerable.",

Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults.\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult\u2019s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving.\nSo, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it\u2019s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall.\nIf you want to learn more, you\u2019re in the right place.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll cover:\n* How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent \u2014 or yourself \u2014 safer,\n* Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips,\n* The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls,\n* A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself.\nFirst, understand why older people fall\nThere are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons.\nSo how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk?\nNow, you can \u2014 and should \u2014 try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews.\nBut if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.",

This year, I've done 163,581 miles of it.\nI love that when you fly a lot, the airport social media staff say 'hello' on Twitter when you arrive and the cabin crew on your home route (or even on the Brisbane-Dubai non-stop route) recognise you from last time. I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur. All that said, flying strangles our planet as much as eating too much red meat, and for many, many reasons, I've wanted to stop flying quite so much, while not restricting the spread and growth of the ideas from our firm, NoTosh.\nI'm quite sure that nobody reading this blog really cares about how much I travel, but keeping an annual count on it has become a new year habit. When I started working at Channel 4, and then continuing when I created NoTosh, I wanted to keep track of what seemed like an interminable number of miles on the road and in the air. By 2012, 2013 and last year, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever be able to get the number of miles down when they seemed to represent even more trips to the moon and back each and every year.\nWhen you run a company based in Edinburgh with a great team living in Melbourne, you could easily spend your life on a plane - one flying to Melbourne feels better than two or more flying to Edinburgh. Indeed, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it felt like I really did spend my life on a plane, as I went to the moon and back in my annual travel, with anything up to seven trips a year to Australia.",

    "context": "I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening:\nDo we want to close the achievement gap?\nWe know we can close the gap. It\u2019s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university.\nBoyd borrowed from his own mother\u2019s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother\u2019s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent.\nWhat kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three \u2018teams\u2019 in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing \u201cthe gap\u201d largely on attainment.\nFirst of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide. Is the law or medicine degree we value not vocational? (Are all General Practitioners not Plumbers, as Dr Murray on the panel suggests?)",

    "context": "Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 \u201cA\u201ds, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one\u2019s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next.\nMurray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors.\nShe set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other\u2019s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?\nStarting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a \u201cculture of obstacles\u201d. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.",

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \"Dog paddle,\" and we all laughed. \"Tiger paddle,\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them.\nOur swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake.\nI liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.",

Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries.\nShe checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay.\nThen she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there.\nBut what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn $2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

It was a perfect day--seventy degrees, sunny. That had to be part of the reason. And the sermon title was 'Forgiveness Fighters.' People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage.\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother?\nMaybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened. But he had moved out of the house during his first semester at Lamar University--even though it was only forty minutes away, in Beaumont. A fellow music major had been more than happy to let Greg share the little rent house and the expenses.\nRalph Tenorly had sent his wife to the grocery store for more chips and dip.

Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it.\nThe shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it\u2019s a nice one so it doesn\u2019t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application \u2013 the second application lathers a lot more easily.\nI definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I\u2019ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I\u2019ve used it \u2013 the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too.

It has quite a strong scent, but it\u2019s a nice one so it doesn\u2019t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application \u2013 the second application lathers a lot more easily.\nI definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I\u2019ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I\u2019ve used it \u2013 the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel \u2013 my scalp feels soothed and calm and there\u2019s no hint of itching. I\u2019ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, it\u2019s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.",

    "context": "I\u2019ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I\u2019ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\nToday I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag.\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.",

I haven\u2019t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space!\nToday I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo.

    "context": "PAUL Reynolds doodled idly on a bar napkin as he sipped at his margarita. All around him tourists of every size and shape were donning paper pirate hats and plastic eye patches. They were part of a relatively new Key West tradition called the Booty Hunt - a glorified bar crawl where participants followed a \"treasure map\" that led them from bar to bar, with occasional stops in private homes, and where the chief treasure to be found was the pleasure of being surrounded by fellow drunks and saying \"Arrrr\" a lot. Paul had participated a few times himself and was kind of embarrassed at how much fun it was. His pen drew a rough sketch of the crowd, although in his version they were actual pirates, in full dress with real swords and pistols and parrots.\nHe took another sip and glanced around the bar, wondering where his drinking companion had gotten to. It was still early - just an hour or so after sunset, and Crooked Pete's was only half full. Located on Simonton, a block off the tourist-choked sidewalks of Duval Street, the bar hadn't hit its stride for the evening yet. The real crowd and the regulars would come later, once they had gotten a bite to eat and were ready for some serious, cheap drinking.\nHe saw his friend Sandee emerge - finally - from the bathroom, smiling at Paul from across the bar while maneuvering through the gaggle of barhopping buccaneers. Thick, cascading black curls complemented Sandee's black sequined mini-dress that clung to every slim curve and emphasized shapely breasts. Sandee winked at one of the tourists, blowing the man a kiss as he ogled in naked admiration.\n\"Did you miss me?\" Sandee asked, sitting down beside Paul.\n\"Of course,\" Paul replied, sliding another margarita to Sandee. \"But your drink missed you more. All your ice is melting.\"\n\"Oh, the poor darlings,\" Sandee cooed, licking the salt on the rim suggestively before taking a long swallow that emptied a third of the contents.",

    "context": "The classic Key West-style house just off Fleming looked much like the rest of the residences on the block - two-story wooden frame walls and peaked roofs with shallow porches nearly butting up against the sidewalk. Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful.\nInside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself.\nShe heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out.\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him.\n\"Mopping,\" she said, her voice flat.\n\"Right. But why are you mopping here? Whose house is this anyway?\"\n\"It's one we just added to the roster last week. The cleaning service hasn't had a chance to get in here yet.\"\n\"I see that,\" said Paul. \"So why're you cleaning it tonight?\"\n\"We're cleaning it tonight because the Guidarizzi's decided to make a surprise visit to their winter home in Key West. They're coming in tomorrow afternoon. Every other decent place is filled up, so we have to use this one instead.\"",

A British brand whose aim is to create products \u2018which are as close to nature as possible\u2019, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they\u2019re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I\u2019ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven\u2019t found anything that I don\u2019t like yet!\nThis month I\u2019ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time \u2013 my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!\n\nI was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.\nThis Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don\u2019t like products that smell overpowering. It\u2019s a bit \u2018planty\u2019, I think it\u2019s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don\u2019t absolutely love the fragrance, but it\u2019s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).",

I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.",

    "context": "KEY WEST, with its scattering of 19th-century wooden homes, is one of the few places in Florida where an 80-year-old building isn't far and away the most ancient manmade structure in town. Even so, the La Concha Hotel, built in 1925, is certainly the largest historical building on the island that's still being used for its original purpose. At all of seven stories, it would scarcely qualify as a boutique hotel in a big city, but for this island it served as a skyscraper.\nThe three of them walked into the marble-floored lobby, instantly chilled by the hotel's powerful air-conditioning (one of many post-1920s updates in the building, along with the computer reservation system and the Starbucks franchise). Winston peered around the crowded room, focusing in particular on a tall, gaunt man wearing a black suit and top hat and carrying a gnarled wooden cane. The dark stranger was ushering a gaggle of camera-wielding tourists out the side door and into the hotel's driveway.\n\"Ghost Tour,\" Paul explained to Winston. \"They walk around town, and the guide tells tales. It's fun.\"\n\"It does sound interesting,\" said Winston, chuckling.\n\"We've been trying to get a piece of that,\" said Chloe, \"But the owners are pretty stubborn. It would be a nice compliment to Paul's fake s\u00e9ance racket.\"\n\"You perform fake s\u00e9ances?\" Winston asked Paul.\n\"Not unless I have to, no. But I... what's the word... oversee a couple who do. Sometimes I step in and lend a hand if one of them is sick.\" In fact, Paul had written the original scripts and come up with the gags and tricks the performers used to put on their little show. Once he'd perfected it, he'd recruited two actors to do the nightly ritual and handle all the details. It provided a small but steady revenue stream for the Crew, and their hidden cameras sometimes picked up other useful information as well.",

In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art.\nHis work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly.\nIt was truly amazing.\nIn 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

Sitting at the bar in Se\u00f1or Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew.\nHe had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee.",

I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera.\nThis is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be \u2013 and how careful I also am.

Those days where the wind is so strong you can\u2019t instastory for talking (I\u2019m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer \u2018er, not sure\u2019.\nSo I thought I\u2019d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn\u2019t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems.\n1. I hate photographs of myself.\nIronic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don\u2019t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result.\n2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip.\nIt has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip \u2013 but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better?\n3. Pastels aren\u2019t really my shade.\nAgain, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I\u2019m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I\u2019m totally ok with that.\n4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera.\nThis is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be \u2013 and how careful I also am. I lovingly wrapped my camera in a soft scarf every day for 3 weeks, growled under my breath at anyone who looked like they might jostle me and at one point found myself accidentally at the top of a dormant volcano with it.

    "context": "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don\u2019t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i\u2019m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I\u2019m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious \ud83d\ude09 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they\u2019ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a very specifically located circular cutter.",

She rarely had an occasion to drive out of town--and it was not a big town. Sherman, Texas has about 36,000 residents.\nShe pulled into the old strip mall parking lot. Most of the stores and other businesses were barely hanging on. The place hadn't seen decent shopping traffic since the 1980s. But it was the perfect location for Rebecca and her partner. They didn't need shoppers. All they needed was cheap office space. Theirs was narrow, but deep, with a reception area, two offices and a bathroom.",

    "context": "Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, \u201cmore work\u201d did not mean more of the existing work they already did. \u201cMore work\u201d did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired.\nMore work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I\u2019m a programmer. And \u201cmanagement\u201d decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I\u2019d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work.\nSo, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices:\nI do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6.\nOption 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It\u2019s not what you hired me for, and it\u2019s not what you pay me for.\nWhen my boss replied, \u201cOur company is not in the position to pay for two roles\u201d, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don\u2019t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages.\n1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.\nTakeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass.",

    "context": "Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it\u2019s certainly important, especially in older adults.\nAs anyone who has experienced occasional \u2014 or even chronic \u2014 constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being.\nConstipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as:\n* Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits\n* Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful\n* Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia\n* Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized)\n* Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel\n* Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation\nFortunately, it\u2019s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia.\nThe trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren\u2019t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more \u201cserious\u201d health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I\u2019ve found that the average person doesn\u2019t know enough to correctly choose among them.\nAlso, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it\u2019s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing \u2014 or worsening \u2014 an older person\u2019s constipation.\nFor instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.\nIn short, if you\u2019re an older adult, or if you\u2019re helping an older loved one with health issues, it\u2019s worthwhile to learn the basics of how constipation should be evaluated and managed. This way, you\u2019ll be better equipped to get help from your health providers, and if it seems advisable, choose among OTC laxative options.",

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty \u2014 it is full of food I want to make and eat. It\u2019s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque.\nI have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu \u2014 homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy).\nYes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia\u2019s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple \u2014 water, flour, cream, eggs, \u2014 you probably have them all in your house already.

    "context": "The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations.",

We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we\u2019d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place.\nWe were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet.\nI was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up\u2026 Oh, here\u2019s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food.\nWe got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived\u2014so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there.\nWe did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month.

    "context": "David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW.\nWhile universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980\u2019s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself?\nDavid Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold\u2019s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it\u2019s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.\nTo borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold:\n1. It\u2019s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media.\n2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are.\n3. It\u2019s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.",

    "context": "It\u2019s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I\u2019m in no way suggesting I\u2019m going to make a fortune, nor that I\u2019m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices.\nArt blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I\u2019m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to.\nI\u2019d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as \u2018art\u2019.\nOver the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it\u2019s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn\u2019t imagine how I ever functioned without it.",

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it\u2019s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire\u2019s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it\u2019s a pretty beautiful place, it\u2019s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that\u2019s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I\u2019d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah\u2019s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it\u2019s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I\u2019d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people\u2019s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.\nOur setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire\u2019s front right and one on Claire\u2019s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR\u2019s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire\u2019s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire\u2019s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne\u2019s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.",

Or maybe it did?\nThe first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie\u2019s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie\u2019s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell\u2019s script and getting any other shots we needed to get.\nPerhaps we didn\u2019t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn\u2019t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn\u2019t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I\u2019m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I\u2019m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else\u2019s ass.\nThe main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes \u2013 however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film \u2013 but with them as stands in \u2013 just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of creating the faux film, then reflecting on it, then shooting the real thing.",

    "context": "Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn\u2019t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus).\nWe sat there for about 4\u20135 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip.\nShe was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation\u2014I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it\u2019s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used.\nAs the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations.",

I didn\u2019t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention.\nWe got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second.\nI can\u2019t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work.\nThen I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of:\n\u201cStep 15: Skip steps 1\u201314 and put your pencil down.\u201d\nYou gotta be freaking kidding me.\nWe\u2019re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day.\nBut I look back now on this \u201cprank\u201d and I realize that she was kind of\u2026wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it. Just a waste of time really.\nNote: I have never built a Death Star LEGO set.",

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success.\nAdd a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine\nA simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities \u2013 the things you are going to do anyway.\nFor example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster.\nAs you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories.\nWhen it\u2019s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can \u2013 stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal.\nWhen you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song \u2013 make those tiles shine.\nPlay fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum.\nWork for longer periods of time \u2013 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there.

What was the situation and what did you do or say?\u201d\nAs senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won\u2019t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient.\nOn one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating.

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.",

What was the situation and what did you do or say?\u201d\nAs senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won\u2019t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient.\nOn one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own.\nSuddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says \u201c[insert demand here] or I\u2019m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].\u201d\nThe situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, \u201cSTOP! DROP IT, NOW!\u201d He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying.\nWhat happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it\u2019s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren\u2019t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation\u2019s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved.\n* IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes. As an Eagle Scout myself, I am proud of the values promoted.",

    "context": "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens is stored in your sub-conscious.",

There was a dark side to success.\nFairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals \u2013 it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources.\nProfessional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level.\nPsychology Today tells us that \u201cBurnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly \u2013 often because of their \u201cI can do everything\u201d personalities, they rarely see it coming.\u201d",

Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don\u2019t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them \u2013 especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\nDon\u2019t stuff your emotions!\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand \u2013 not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature\u2019s way of releasing stress.

But today I want to move in a little different direction.\nIn addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges \u2013 including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression.\nPractices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being\nAccept Your Feelings\nStuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don\u2019t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them \u2013 especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\nDon\u2019t stuff your emotions!\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand \u2013 not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature\u2019s way of releasing stress. Don\u2019t beat yourself up afterward!",

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment \u2013 even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life.\nWhen you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite.\nThere is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence.\nWhen you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living.\nIt is not just physical well-being that is neglected \u2013 mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.\nWhen your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals\nConvenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body.

    "context": "I repeatedly see people asking advice on forums as to which is the best detox to do. Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?",

    "context": "I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes ($AU39), they are still much more affordable than the $AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one).\nAfter seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted.\nI argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly $80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a $10 voucher for my birthday and I got a $30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For $38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite.\nGraphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck.\nHere is Nalini's review:\nI've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless.\nIn my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit.\nAs a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.",

Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for.

    "context": "Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly \u201cleaking\u201d blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty.\nApparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained.\nThe nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she\u2019d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn\u2019t keep myself from laughing loud and long.\nShe then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no \u201chard feelings.\u201d",

    "context": "I started reading beauty blogs rather than magazines because I loved their honesty. With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.\nBUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental. I just want to bust out a red pen and edit the post.\nThe carton below, which is floating around Facebook at the moment, was my inspiration for writing this post as it really highlights how, by making the slightest grammatical error, the entire meaning of the sentence changes.\nI suspect that, if you are a similar grammar fanatic, you are sitting here, nodding your head, thinking 'man, that drives me crazy, too!'. If you are not a grammar fanatic then you might be thinking 'hey, what are you whinging about - it is only a couple of letters out of order'. This is why it annoys me so much - I read a sentence but it doesn't quite make sense, so I have to go back and read it again to get an understanding. As soon as I start doing that, I am no longer reading the content of the post but am instead trying to decipher what is being written. As soon as I have stumbled over a few sentences I give up and stop reading.",

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that\u2019s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\n\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way.

He loves differently than I need to be loved and it\u2019s just not in him to love me that way.\nA few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies.\nHe\u2019s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another\u2019s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily.\nI never knew I needed romance because I\u2019d never had it.

It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators.

And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships\u2014relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind.\nIt is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding.

    "context": "Last month we spent a few wonderful days visiting our friends Rosa and Massimo who live just outside of Trento. It was our third visit to the area (on one of them I snapped up this recipe for persimmon cake), so I feel it\u2019s about time to share some our favourite things that we\u2019ve been shown by locals.\nTrento is only a four hour drive from Florence \u2014 passing Bologna and Verona on the way, which could make very good pit stops if you feel the need to, FYI \u2014 yet it feels a world away in terms of the landscape and the food, from the golden, rolling hills of Tuscany. Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names.\nTrento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones.\nEating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites. Somehow there was always room for dessert, though \u2014 adopted from German and Austrian specialties, you can find cakes like black forest, schwarzplententorte (buckwheat cake, the recipe is below), sachertorte and linzertorte, often lathered with homemade, forest-picked berry jam and whipped cream.",

I will be 40 this year.\nMy son, the oldest, turned 15 this year \u2026 the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally.\nNow, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of \u201cbody safety\u201d talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it\u2019s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often.\nI\u2019ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others.",

    "context": "When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it\u2019s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next\u2026 to turning them into rose petal jam, of course.\nMy friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour\u2019s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey.\nIt wasn\u2019t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees \u2014 little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack.\nWith the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona\u2019s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources \u2014 Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice\u2019s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.",

    "context": "As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons.\nFrom my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness.\nBefore I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms.\nI was living in a fantasy world.\nYou cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!!\nI have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward.\nThe second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed.\nI am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.\nBut, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!\nBe safe!",

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn\u2019t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS\u2019s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought \u201cDear Lord someone\u2019s losing a limb today.\u201d When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn\u2019t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.",

    "context": "There\u2019s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It\u2019s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy\u2019s southern heel and involves my daughter\u2019s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco\u2019s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family\u2019s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. \u201cHe was no adonis,\u201d noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed.\nWhen Anna\u2019s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter\u2019s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto \u2014 Mario, Marco\u2019s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War \u2014 but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work.\nNonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as \u201csugo di nonna Anna\u201d and, oddly, \u201camatriciana\u201d (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta).\nBut these polpette \u2013 plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia \u2013 were passed down to Anna\u2019s daughter in law, Angela\u2019s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law, Franca, Riccardo\u2019s wife, who continues to make them today for her own grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It has become this Tuscan family\u2019s recipe, spread throughout the branches of the family tree, made for guests and special occasions especially (it feeds a crowd wonderfully).",

The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car.\nSometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it.

    "context": "Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair.\nTaken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to \u201cthe more the better\u201d.\nSo how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\nBut the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The \u201crecreational athlete\u201d, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range.\nSo how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special \u201chigh protein\u201d training diet.\nSportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it\u2019s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone.\nThis has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that\u2019s before using any protein powders.\nBut protein supplements can\u2019t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.",

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session.

    "context": "When I was entering my Sophomore year in High School, we had just moved from a single 4-way stop-sign town, to a bigger city with actual city buses! In order to get to school, I had to ride a city bus for the 1st time, without information/assistance! I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses! I noticed every time we went around a corner, it seemed a bell would ring. I falsely assumed it meant HANG ON! So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight! As we neared my bus stop to get off, the bus whizzed past it, without stopping! Panic began to set in quickly. I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn\u2019t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke! When I walked into my house, I was immediately confronted on why was I late, why did I smell like smoke, etc.! I burst into tears, and had to tell about my horrible day, but I didn\u2019t get into trouble! WHEW!",

    "context": "Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance \u2013 to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit.\nSupplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation.\nBut what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking.\nTo see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers.\nThe clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality.\nFrom the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.\nOne study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D supplementation in elderly people or omega-3 fatty acids in people with cardiovascular disease.",

    "context": "Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The human digestive tract makes all the enzymes needed for digestion.",

Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs.\nThis morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office.\nWhen I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen.\nMy wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.\nLater in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY.\nThat has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one.

The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units.\nDavid Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\" he told VOA.\nThe administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts \u2013 that should be the end of the policy,\" Bier added.\nThe moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties.\nNielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act.\n\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\" the secretary said. \"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\"\nThe outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party's conservative and moderate wings.",

Hear me out.\nI was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week.\nOne day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that \u201cwe need to take a break.\u201d Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup.\nNow, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn\u2019t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university.\nSeveral weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her.\nWhat really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends.\nNow, I healed properly and we\u2019re back to being friends (Yes, it\u2019s possible to stay friends with your ex). It was a bad experience to live through indeed, but it really changed me into a more stable, more productive person. In a way, I\u2019m thankful to this girl for who I am today.\nStay strong!",

Very, very quickly, absolutely.\"\n\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day.\n\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate.\n\u200bLater, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \"not surprised\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\"We welcome the outcomes,\" the defense spokesman said. \"We support them.\"\nTrump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\"\nThe U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \"are no longer a factor.\"",

We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys.\nLong story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen.\nTed married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be.\nOther than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages. Meaning that family is priority but if you got some free time, go enjoy yourself. So we still get together a couple times a year (some more than others) and have a good time.",

He was rude to the teachers and a bit of a bad boy and all the girls swooned over him. I on the other hand was not, at one point he managed to get my number and was texting me. We spoke for a bit but once he started asking me for pictures of myself I stopped the contact, I knew he wasn't to be trusted from the beginning and decided he wasn't right for me. Then it was quite funny how one day we had a class where the rooms were next to each other and in between was a printer that both classes shared. I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also. He asked me for a hug and just raised an eyebrow, then I saw my work had printed so I lent over to grab it and he thought I was going in for the hug. So he shut his eyes and held out his arms only to open them to see me walking off with my paper.

    "context": "So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, \u201cIt says you have already played this role.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.\u201d She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay\u2014(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can\u2019t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing \u201cmy\u201d role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal\u2026and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn\u2019t auditioned\u2026Overall, it wasn\u2019t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying\u2026",

    "context": "So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, \u201cIt says you have already played this role.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.\u201d She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay\u2014(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can\u2019t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing \u201cmy\u201d role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal\u2026and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn\u2019t auditioned\u2026Overall, it wasn\u2019t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying\u2026",

They told me, and about a half hour later called the radiology department from the pharmacy phone and asked for her.\nShe said all the girls in the department were huddled around the phone and giggling while we talked.
