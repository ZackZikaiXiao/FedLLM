The parents  glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly. The kids stared at the floor the whole time. I dropped Mia into a chair at the nurses' station and waited. Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me. I was still waiting for them to figure this out when one of them came over and asked, \"What's the problem?\" \"No problem,\" I said. \"I just want to drop her off.\" We both looked at Mia. A string of drool slowly slipped from her chin to her chest. \"Has she been drinking?\" the nurse asked. \"I'm not really sure,\" I said. The nurse looked back at me. \"You're not really sure? Now what does that mean?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"I found her. I thought maybe I could leave her here.\" \"Sure, we'll just have to fill out the paperwork for that,\" the nurse said. She smiled at the other nurses when she said it, and I couldn't tell if she was joking or not. She had me go through Mia's pockets, but all I could find was a piece of paper with an address written on it. Five Crossings. I couldn't find her ID anywhere. The nurse entered my name and address on a form, then took us down the hall to another room. What seemed like hours later, an old, red-faced doctor finally came in. He glanced at Mia and then washed his hands in the sink. \"You the father or the boyfriend?\" he asked. \"Neither,\" I said. \"I've only just met her.\" I couldn't take my eyes off the garbage can in the corner. It was full of bloody bandages. I wondered what had gone on in there before we'd arrived.",

I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch.

Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown.

And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose).

    "context": "Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door. The kitchen stank of stale cigarettes and the dregs of spirit bottles.",

It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home. He lived in one of the straggle of council houses leading up to the tip. Carly Furnish and her folks lived two doors down.

Built high on the center of Galveston Island, away from the deadly storms of the Gulf, away from the noise and stink of the port. White servants and negro slaves. Fair-haired women to sit at the piano in his parlor. Dark-skinned women to open their legs to him in the secrecy of the night... He sat up in a sweat. I will think no evil thoughts, he told himself. Outside, the sun rose over New Orleans. Horse-drawn carts creaked and rattled through the streets, and chickens complained about the light. The smell of the Mississippi, damp and sexual, floated through the open window. Malone got up and put a robe on over his nightshirt, despite the heat. He turned up the gas lamp over the desk, took out pen, ink and paper, and began to write. 'My dearest Becky...' * He smelled the French Market before he saw it, a mixture of decayed fruit, coffee, and leather. He crossed Decatur Street to avoid a side of beef hung over the sidewalk, swarming with flies. Voices shouted in a dozen different languages. All manner of decrepit wooden carts stood on the street, their contents passed from hand to hand until they disappeared under the yellow canvas awnings of the market. Beyond the levee Malone could see the tops of the masts of the tall ships that moved toward the Governor Nicholl's Street Wharf.",

His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \"Hook her up,\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \"I said hook her up,\" Dorian said. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said for the third time. \"I said hook her up!\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney. Coffee stain or no coffee stain, Dorian was a commanding presence.",

The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.",

    "context": "I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I\u2019ll call \u201cLuna\u201d.\nSo, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you\u2019re talking to someone like that and you\u2019re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren\u2019t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say \u201cThis is your fault\u201d.\nWell, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do \u201csomething bad\u201d and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive.\nSo most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she\u2019d be happy because her life wasn\u2019t worsened at all.\nBut I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing.\nBut I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only \u201cfriend\u201d at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn\u2019t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn\u2019t been friends with her.",

It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks.\nWarm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair.

    "context": "In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\"\nIn other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.\nThe creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \"a local Amiga gaming championship\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest).\nThe school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.",

    "context": "\"That's Glenn Miller,\" my father said. \"But it can't be.\"\nHe had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo.\n\"You know the tune, of course,\" he said.\n\"'King Porter Stomp.'\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off.\n\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\"\n\"So why can't it be Miller?\" I asked.\n\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \"They sound drunk.\"\nMy father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.\nBut there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.\nThe date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.",

I let out a sigh of relief that I didn\u2019t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them.\nI\u2019ve been on them for a few years now, and it\u2019s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I\u2019m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don\u2019t like being behind the wheel), I don\u2019t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own?

They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn\u2019t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids.\nOnce, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her $5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before.

Of the sort that good men share about a fire and over a meal.\" He assayed a grin as he cast his gaze over his colleagues.\n\"No doubt a fiction of the sun,\" offered Tavarius in a commiserating tone. He sat across from the young guard, idly poking at food on the beaten metal plate that was set at his feet. He skewered a square of meat with the tip of his long knife and lifted it to his lips, holding it poised before his mouth a moment before finally clamping square, yellowed teeth about it and pulling it free with a jerk.\n\"It wasn't the sun,\" Sartas retorted petulantly.\nTavarius shrugged, then wiped a trail of juice from his chin with the back of one hand and said, \"Be careful, lad.\" He waggled the blade of his knife back and forth in the young man's direction, frowning with intense sagacity. \"You'd be wise to consider spending less time out there in the heat of day, tramping back and forth as though you were guarding the King's own jewels. All that sweating and panting. And for what?\" He snorted and shook his head. \"Such devotion may well be admirable in some quarters, boy, but you'll curry no favor here with that sort of attitude.\"",

    "context": "I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on.\nThe city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's.\nI had an idea.\nI made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up.\nNow on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.\nNo doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.",

    "context": "Bryan C. Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum\u2019s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of \u201cgreen spaces\u201d such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine.\nIn particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation.\nFor Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli\u2019s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.\u201d\nSacred Landscapes opens on October 10, 2017, at the Getty Museum, where it complements the exhibition Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith in Renaissance Venice. The exhibition catalog is available online now.",

    "context": "If you\u2019ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.",

Uncle Arehl (I don't know precisely whose uncle he is, or for what the two initials of his name once stood) saunters slowly across a dry, patchy lawn, and the camera follows him. For some reason I'm more interested in the lawn--if it can be called that--than in the people on it. The sun in the movie is blazing, and everyone filmed looks only briefly at the camera before averting their faces once again to look at the stubbly grass. The camera pans once again and I can see an incredibly rutted path leading from the porch to the fence at the edge of the yard, broken pieces of concrete amid deep tire tracks fossilized in sun-baked mud. The fence is low, wire like a chain-link, but lower, with metal stakes holding it up instead of tubes.",

    "context": "Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source\u2019s ecosystem.\nI am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.\nI find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said \u2018M$\u2019 instead of \u2018MS\u2019 (ugh.)\nThings have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me.\nThings have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don\u2019t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt.\nStill though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them?\nA little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft\u2019s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce proprietary software and use software patents in departments such as Windows and Office.",

    "context": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies.

Their tweets are less personal and less inclusive than those used by scientists.\nThis is what appeared in April 2017 when we gathered data on tens of thousands of tweets from the Twitter accounts of both the top 25 economists and 25 scientists as identified by IDEAS and Science, including the top three economists at the time, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Erik Brynjolfsson and, on the other side, the top three scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, and Richard Dawkins. At that time those accounts covered roughly two thirds of all the following.\nThe timing is significant because 2016 has been declared the year of post-truth politics, the year in which appeals to emotions (pathos) superseded the significance of factual evidence-based information (logos), affecting people\u2019s constructions and interpretations of events.

This has been accompanied by the growing prominence of political \u201calt\u201d movements (e.g. UKIP, the Alt-right) and their aggressive, provocative, and populist narratives, and \u201cfake news\u201d leading to political shock events such as Brexit and the Trump election.\nThe relatively low traction of economists in these public debates has been and continues to be an important issue. Does the public not trust economists? Don\u2019t they understand what economists do and how they work? Is their work misrepresented in the media? And how do economists themselves interact with public opinion?",

The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival.

Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby.\nThe ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself.

Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don\u2019t have these networks, so how can they develop them? One way is through the media.",

    "context": "In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it \u2013 in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford\u2019s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I\u2019d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we \u201csee\u201d data.\nMy dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as \u201cpalaeobiologists\u201d \u2013 meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s time, palaeontology \u2013 especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record \u2013 involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than \u201cstamp collecting\u201d.",

North Korea in particular objected to Bolton\u2019s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country\u2019s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country\u2019s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later.\nUnless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions.\nPresident Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and \u201cbe very rich\u201d if he makes a deal to end his country\u2019s nuclear program.\nNorth Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government \u201cignorant and incompetent,\u201d and suspending working-level bilateral talks last week.",

Beasley said he was given \u201cremarkable\u201d access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit.\nBeasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor.\nWith the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North\u2019s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies.\nDetails over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.\nEnding the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North\u2019s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.\nHumanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made potential donors reluctant to contribute for fear of inadvertently violating sanctions.",

    "context": "Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived.\nGreg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost.\nGreg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance.\nGreg gladly paid $4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.\nHis little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.",

This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.\nSo, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan.\n\"I would like a large--\"\n\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\"\nThe Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one.\nGreg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.",

    "context": "SEOUL \u2014 South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States.\nSouth Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was \u201cinternally carrying out preparations\u201d to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement.\nNorth Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country\u2019s external trade.\nSeeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal.\nBut easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North\u2019s denuclearization promises.\n\u201cOnce the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,\u201d said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program.\nSouth Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed.\nAt the recent inter-Korean summit, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to increase economic cooperation, in addition to supporting the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.",

    "context": "SEOUL \u2014 Despite recent tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world.\nLieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters\u2019 high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family\u2019s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home.\n\u201cWe go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We\u2019re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,\u201d said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army.\nThis is Puskas\u2019 fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea.\n\u201cI think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,\u201d said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States.\nThe U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country.\nCamp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people.\nThere are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course.\n\u201cI have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I\u2019ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I\u2019ve been on because everything is new,\u201d said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.",

You\u2019ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for!\nI thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin.\nIt\u2019s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you\u2019re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions.\nIf you made these decorative pumpkins, and don\u2019t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We\u2019re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house.\nThe following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you\u2019d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.",

Many of these online entrepreneurs had become my friends and I'd managed to find myself a new girlfriend - Maggie, a Welsh journalist who was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website. This was a brilliant blag: it meant we could eat at some of London's best restaurants and never pay a penny. Life was wonderful: The Friday Thing and the Guardian column meant that my plan to use the Internet to become hugely famous and successful was firmly on track, I'd made lots of new friends, and, on top of all that, I was getting laid and eating gourmet food for free. Even Sam Lewis was jealous, and he was rich.\nMeanwhile, the people I was writing about were not having such an easy time of it. 2003 was a really strange time to be covering the 'new media' industry - mainly because no one was really sure for how long there would be an industry left to cover.\nThe dot com boom of 1999 seemed like a millennium ago: a period in history as crazy as the tulip craze or the South Sea Bubble look to us now.\nThe first signs of trouble for the industry had come in 2000. As the century turned, so had the market and - to use the parlance of analysts - the boom had turned out to be a bubble. And then the bubble had burst.",

    "context": "Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts.\nThe renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition.\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \"futile\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto.\nBut it was House conservatives who defeated the $867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed.\nThe House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House \u2014 had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition.\nThe immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system.\nThe Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans.\nFor them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients.\nThe deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday.\n\"It's not a fatal blow \u2014 it's just a reorganize,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\"\nMeadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.",

    "context": "And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension.\nSince this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I\u2019m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family.\nBy the way, if you\u2019ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines.\nThe core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same:\n* Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here),\n* Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014,\n* And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control.\nPerhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d as we treat BP to get lower and lower.\nScientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150).\nFrom there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120.\nHowever, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

    "context": "The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \"commonsense\" move.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday.\nIn a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department.\n\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\"",

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu\n* What to know about flu shots for older adults\n* What\u2019s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu season\n* Which influenza vaccination is probably best for most older adults\n* What to do if your older parent or relative is unwilling or unable to get vaccinated",

They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries.\nA test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat.\nMany voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America\u2019s heartland.\nThe race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).",

I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).",

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \"Dog paddle,\" and we all laughed. \"Tiger paddle,\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them.\nOur swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake.\nI liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.",

I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop\u00ae Christmas make-up collections, and I think it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up.\nThen everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They\u2019re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it.\nI then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop\u00ae Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are.\nI also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop\u00ae are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just \u00a345. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There\u2019s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just \u00a350 which I thought was a great fun idea.",

    "context": "Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I\u2019m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it\u2019s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I\u2019m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too \u2013 mainly fragrances.\nI had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop\u00ae, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn\u2019t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos \u2013 and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it.\nThe shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it\u2019s a nice one so it doesn\u2019t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application \u2013 the second application lathers a lot more easily.\nI definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I\u2019ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I\u2019ve used it \u2013 the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel \u2013 my scalp feels soothed and calm and there\u2019s no hint of itching. I\u2019ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, it\u2019s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.",

But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I\u2019ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\nToday I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag.\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.",

Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men.\nDuval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time.\nBut something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist. Heeding the subliminal warning, she changed plans and stepped out into the crawling Duval Street traffic. A purple taxi honked angrily but she just smiled as she strode across the street and stared intently at a display of cheap, tasteless T-shirts in a storefront window.",

The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit.

    "context": "PAUL Reynolds doodled idly on a bar napkin as he sipped at his margarita. All around him tourists of every size and shape were donning paper pirate hats and plastic eye patches. They were part of a relatively new Key West tradition called the Booty Hunt - a glorified bar crawl where participants followed a \"treasure map\" that led them from bar to bar, with occasional stops in private homes, and where the chief treasure to be found was the pleasure of being surrounded by fellow drunks and saying \"Arrrr\" a lot. Paul had participated a few times himself and was kind of embarrassed at how much fun it was. His pen drew a rough sketch of the crowd, although in his version they were actual pirates, in full dress with real swords and pistols and parrots.\nHe took another sip and glanced around the bar, wondering where his drinking companion had gotten to. It was still early - just an hour or so after sunset, and Crooked Pete's was only half full. Located on Simonton, a block off the tourist-choked sidewalks of Duval Street, the bar hadn't hit its stride for the evening yet. The real crowd and the regulars would come later, once they had gotten a bite to eat and were ready for some serious, cheap drinking.\nHe saw his friend Sandee emerge - finally - from the bathroom, smiling at Paul from across the bar while maneuvering through the gaggle of barhopping buccaneers. Thick, cascading black curls complemented Sandee's black sequined mini-dress that clung to every slim curve and emphasized shapely breasts. Sandee winked at one of the tourists, blowing the man a kiss as he ogled in naked admiration.\n\"Did you miss me?\" Sandee asked, sitting down beside Paul.\n\"Of course,\" Paul replied, sliding another margarita to Sandee. \"But your drink missed you more. All your ice is melting.\"\n\"Oh, the poor darlings,\" Sandee cooed, licking the salt on the rim suggestively before taking a long swallow that emptied a third of the contents.",

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset.\nPaul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island.\n\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\" Paul asked.\n\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\" she replied.\n\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\"\n\"You could call it something nice.

    "context": "Just a quick review today to talk about these haircare and bodycare products from Yes to\u2026\nRegular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I\u2019m always looking out for new natural skincare and bodycare ranges as I\u2019m passionate about products that don\u2019t contain lots of nasty chemicals. Yes to\u2026 is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials.\nThere are 6 collections, each involves saying \u2018Yes to\u2019 a different fruit or vegetable. The products I\u2019ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*.\nYes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash \u2013 the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth.\nThe ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages.\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner \u2013 I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free.

    "context": "Just a quick review today to talk about these haircare and bodycare products from Yes to\u2026\nRegular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I\u2019m always looking out for new natural skincare and bodycare ranges as I\u2019m passionate about products that don\u2019t contain lots of nasty chemicals. Yes to\u2026 is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials.\nThere are 6 collections, each involves saying \u2018Yes to\u2019 a different fruit or vegetable. The products I\u2019ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*.\nYes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash \u2013 the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth.\nThe ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages.\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner \u2013 I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil.

The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that.\nPaul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that.\nOf course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could.\nThe bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check.",

Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn\u2019t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn\u2019t be bothered to find somewhere.

With several levels of hot and icy plunge pools, sauna and steam rooms, everyone wanders from indoor to outdoor relaxation spots \u2013 from sun-soaked spot to waterfall spout back massages. Bliss.\nIt\u2019s also a place where silence is \u201cessential to the experience. By embracing silence one finds inner stillness, leading to complete relaxation.\u201d To be honest, most people who couldn\u2019t be quiet i.e. me just talked in hushed tones, but it made for a super chilled few hours. Until\u2026\n\u2026I was sitting in one of the steam rooms (does that make the title clickbait? Sorry \u2013 using the title \u2018steam room with Lady Gaga\u2019 made it sound as though we were chickens cooking in a slowcooker) and a very, very slim blonde lady slipped in. Queen Gaga herself.\nI\u2019ve got to be honest, sticking to the \u2018no eye contact with other people who are chillaxing\u2019 rule, I didn\u2019t pay very much attention to what was going on, but after 25 minutes or so of basting relaxing, I stretched languidly \u2013 my bones like toffee \u2013 and wandered out to the next room, and looking up from the drinks table, had to blink several times as she followed me out. Trying to play cool, I tried keep a poker face (after all, she was there to relax and recuperate in the middle of a big Canadian tour, she didn\u2019t need a random Kiwi gawking at her) and watched from the corner of my eye as she walked into one of the big yoga rooms.",

    "context": "So, there I was. Hanging out in my swimsuit, hair drawn back, just minding my own business and relaxing in the delicious, luxurious Scandinave Spa, a stone\u2019s throw from Whistler town centre.\nThe husband and I had split up for the afternoon \u2013 he had decided to traverse the peaks of Whistler and Blackcomb on the peak2peak gondola, and I\u2019d chosen a slightly less terrifying mountain vista to enjoy.\nIt was just one of those days where we\u2019d decided happily to do two different things, and meet up afterwards for a spot of dinner.\nCascading down the hillside, the Scandinave Spa\u2019s rustic installations nestle on the edge of the Lost Lake Park spruce and cedar forest and promises to both relax and invigorate you, and provide an escape from daily stress. With several levels of hot and icy plunge pools, sauna and steam rooms, everyone wanders from indoor to outdoor relaxation spots \u2013 from sun-soaked spot to waterfall spout back massages. Bliss.\nIt\u2019s also a place where silence is \u201cessential to the experience. By embracing silence one finds inner stillness, leading to complete relaxation.\u201d To be honest, most people who couldn\u2019t be quiet i.e. me just talked in hushed tones, but it made for a super chilled few hours. Until\u2026\n\u2026I was sitting in one of the steam rooms (does that make the title clickbait? Sorry \u2013 using the title \u2018steam room with Lady Gaga\u2019 made it sound as though we were chickens cooking in a slowcooker) and a very, very slim blonde lady slipped in. Queen Gaga herself.\nI\u2019ve got to be honest, sticking to the \u2018no eye contact with other people who are chillaxing\u2019 rule, I didn\u2019t pay very much attention to what was going on, but after 25 minutes or so of basting relaxing, I stretched languidly \u2013 my bones like toffee \u2013 and wandered out to the next room, and looking up from the drinks table, had to blink several times as she followed me out. Trying to play cool, I tried keep a poker face (after all, she was there to relax and recuperate in the middle of a big Canadian tour, she didn\u2019t need a random Kiwi gawking at her) and watched from the corner of my eye as she walked into one of the big yoga rooms.",

We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).\nFor some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there.\nOnline tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac.\nIt\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above.

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty \u2014 it is full of food I want to make and eat. It\u2019s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque.\nI have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu \u2014 homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy).\nYes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia\u2019s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple \u2014 water, flour, cream, eggs, \u2014 you probably have them all in your house already.

These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track.\nShe rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER.\nShe died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay.\nAnd the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.\nAnd almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell!\nAnd when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories.\nIt was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that.\nThat's my story.",

By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah\u2019s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it\u2019s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I\u2019d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people\u2019s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.\nOur setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire\u2019s front right and one on Claire\u2019s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR\u2019s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic.

I told him \u201cno thank you, I do not drink\u201d. My arm was laying on top of the booth because I was sitting sideways since my big old pregnant belly would not fit under the table. He reached over and took my hand and said \u201c Come dance with me then\u201d. I again told him I was not interested in dancing. He began to squeeze my hand and insisting I get up and dance with him. I kept telling him no, and pointing to my belly and saying I would not be dancing with anyone. He just kept squeezing my hand harder and trying to pull me out of the booth. I got angry when I felt something break in my hand and screamed at him \u201cGet your effing hands off me!\u201d The bar owner came over to see what the problem was. I explained that \u201cthis jerk just hurt my hand because I would not drink or dance with him!\u201d The owner looked at me crying, and the man laughing, and kicked my friend and I out of the place! Seems the rude SOB was his best friend. I got a bad taste for places of that culture (although I do love the cuisine) and a broken bone in my left hand for my trouble.

    "context": "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said \u201cHelping hands are better than clapping hands\u201d. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work!\nIt was this man\u2019s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India\u2019s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared?\nThe next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us.\nWill a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?\nAre we pointing fingers at ourselves?\nIn the end, we are all in the same team.",

    "context": "Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades.\nUnfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success.\nFairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals \u2013 it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources.\nProfessional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level.\nPsychology Today tells us that \u201cBurnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly \u2013 often because of their \u201cI can do everything\u201d personalities, they rarely see it coming.\u201d",

Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled.\nA mother\u2019s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn\u2019t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning.\nMy usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day.\nSo I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden.\nInside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.\nBetter mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children.

If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.",

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right.\nBut despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price \u2026 always a good starting point.\nAnyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision.\nBut something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further.\nA couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he \u2018kindly\u2019 informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously.\nIt turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course.\nLess than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.\nAs they say in the property business \u2018Location, Location, Location\u2019 is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion.\nSometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.",

    "context": "Exciting news everyone, BIOeffect has now officially launched in Australia. The BIOeffect EGF serum is creating a huge storm world wide. It was first launched in Iceland last year (as it is made by the Icelandic company Sif Cosmetics) and within 6 months of the release it is estimated that 1 in 5 Icelandic women over the age of 30 have purchased the serum. When it was released in France, the serum sold out in the first week at the famous concept store in Paris, Colette. Now, we can finally get it here in Australia and I believe that it will be launching in the US shortly.\nThe serum is highly scientific, and based on reviews around the world, it really appears to work. I have been using it for a week now and my angry line down the middle of my forehead is already seeming less angry. I will post a review once I have been using it for a month or so.\nIf you want to purchase the serum, it is available from the BIOeffect Australia website or if you are looking for updates or reviews on the product then you can either like their Facebook page or follow them on Twitter.\nSo, who is now busting to try the serum? Well, to celebrate the launch, the wonderful people behind BIOeffect Australia, Melanie and Kym, have agreed to sponsor a giveaway of some amazing BIOeffect products. First prize will be one full sized bottle of the amazing BIOeffect serum. This bottle alone is worth $180.00!! In addition there will be two runners up prizes of a 3ml travel sized bottle of the serum. These are worth $40.00 each!\nEntering the competition is simple. All you need to do is have a read of my article, The science behind the BIOeffect EGF Serum explained, and make a comment on that article about what excites you the most about the serum. Are you like me and are blown away by the science? Is it the fact that independent clinical trials are proving that the serum works? Or is there something else that has grabbed you? Please tell me.",

Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

    "context": "I sure have Shannon. But, not for very long! My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.\nNow, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included.

Two coats, completely opaque and streak free.\nIf you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that\u2019s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\n\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way.

So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas.\nI had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).",

Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes.

They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators.

I was living my apartment, I glanced at my reflection, I was wearing a knee length pencil length green skirt, white silk blouse, green jacket to match, white wrist length gloves. On my head I wore a green felt hat, with a long green head pin, to keep the hat on my head. Green shoes and clutch to match. I was afraid, so I took a breath, opened the door, walked out and locked the door. I walked down the stairs, waved to Jean Paul the night concierge, he told me to be careful and have a goodnight, I told him I will see him later. I walked out the front door, turned left and walked down the alley to get to the boulevard. When I got half way through the alley, I heard footsteps. I began walking a little faster. Then a man called my name.. Ana, I turned and saw he had a gun. I screamed and began running. Before I got to the boulevard he shot me in the back, I fell knees first, then I tried to brace myself with my hands. But it was useless, I fell face to the ground, it was an excruciating burning pain. I began to cry, I could see my clutch not to far from me, the content from my clutch lipstick, compact and money scattered. Then I heard his footsteps, he stopped at my head, crunch down, he took his thumb and wiped my lipstick from my bottom lip. I asked him why, in a whisper, because it hurt to talk. He laughed, and said that I was a stupid girl, and that if he could not have me no one else should. He got up and walked away. He left me there dying, I felt that I could not breath and litterly jumped out of the dream. The weird part was that for several days after, I had that burning sensation in the same place I got shot.",

They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).",

    "context": "Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do.

When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (\u201csometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,\u201d she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials.\nShe had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum.\nHer dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women\u2019s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men\u2019s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.",

When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (\u201csometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,\u201d she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials.\nShe had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle.

    "context": "When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it\u2019s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next\u2026 to turning them into rose petal jam, of course.\nMy friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour\u2019s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey.\nIt wasn\u2019t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees \u2014 little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack.\nWith the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona\u2019s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources \u2014 Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice\u2019s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.",

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn\u2019t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS\u2019s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought \u201cDear Lord someone\u2019s losing a limb today.\u201d When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn\u2019t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.",

It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nMy family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses.\nMy dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between.\nIt was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed.\nAs I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway.\nSome people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools.\nI remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether.\nI don\u2019t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn\u2019t do a good job.\nLater in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.\nI still remember hating shoveling snow.

    "context": "Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of.\nThe key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality.\nDigging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised.\nA paradigm shift?

    "context": "My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women\u2019s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said \u201cWhatever doesn\u2019t kill me, makes me stronger\u201d.\nHow did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I\u2019d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.",

    "context": "WHITE HOUSE \u2014 President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\"\nU.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \"the weakest in the history of the world.\"\nTrump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \"Angel Families,\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally.\n\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \"We will secure our borders \u2026 the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\"\nTrump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security.\nCrime assertion\nTrump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens.\nHowever, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.\nFollowing intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \"zero tolerence\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.",

Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs.\nThis morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office.\nWhen I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen.\nMy wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.\nLater in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY.\nThat has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one. Also, I am still looking for the guy who went to complaint office and was never seen thereafter this morning.\nThat can happen to anybody.",

As I got ready, I took one last glanced to my dad.\nI gathered all my medications shoved it in to my bag and went out outside caught the bus that goes to college. I had no plans on going into my classes; I sat onto the college bus stop contemplating if I am going to do it.\nI did it. I chugged down the whole bottle of my anti-depressant. I closed my eyes for a brief moment, I felt like I was about to faint; I checked my phone to see what time was it and I saw my daughter's face on my home screen.\nI said to myself, \"How can you be so stupid?! You have a daughter!\"\nTrying my best to be conscious I caught the bus that goes to the hospital and checked in as a crisis patient in need to see a psychiatrist right away. I told my psychiatrist I tried to kill myself, and he escorted me down to the emergency room and I instantly became a 5150 patient.

But when that same song came to an end, the guy turned around and actually apologized to all of us. He held up his camera and said he wanted a really good shot of the band as they were friends of his. He actually went and bought each of us a beer, so it totally worked out well. We thanked him and he took off.\nThe only excuse I have for us is that we were in college and not glued to MTV or entertainment magazines, and really, only Hey Jealousy had hit the airwaves when we went to the concert. But sure enough, when the Gin Blossoms took the stage, Robin Wilson gave a shout out to those three girls he\u2019d blocked the stage for earlier and hoped we\u2019d enjoyed our beers.\nLike I said, it\u2019s pretty tame, but I thought he handled it with class, so it\u2019s always made me remember their music fondly.",

    "context": "Not exactly. I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me.\nHe didn\u2019t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? \u201cOh Definitely.\u201d Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he\u2019s at least a little sorry about it>\nWrong.\n\u201cOne of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn\u2019t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.\u201d\nI have no problems with divorced men. I can forgive a man who has cheated in his past. But a man who had no problems cheating so frivolously and, in all honestly, would likely do it again without problems? Nope, not for me.",
