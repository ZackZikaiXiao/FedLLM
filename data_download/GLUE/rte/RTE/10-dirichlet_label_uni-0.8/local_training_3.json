It has also been found in wasabi crackers which are manufactured by the Chinese company, Silang House. Another Chinese food company called Marudai Food Co. has also halted the sales of several items such as meat buns, cream buns and corn crepes made with cream over fears that melamine laced powered milk has contaminated their products. So far there have been no reports of any illnesses associated with Marudai Foods.\nHypothesis: 4 children died in Hong Kong because of melamine contained in milk.",
