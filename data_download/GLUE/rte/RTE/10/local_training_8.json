An ambulance service spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald that ambulance officers arrived at Elsternwick Park on Saturday afternoon. They reported Hester had \"attempted suicide\" and suffered \"strangulation\". The 46-year-old-father-of-two was last seen walking his two dogs in the popular suburban park near his home on Friday evening. Hester had a history with bouts of depression, but seemed to be coping well following eight years of therapy. Friends told the The Daily Telegraph, however, that he suffered a recent turmoil in his love life. Firstly, there was the end of his romance with long-time partner and mother of his two daughters, and then a parting last December with New Zealand singer Kashan, whom he planned to wed in May.\nHypothesis: Kashan dated Paul Hester.",
